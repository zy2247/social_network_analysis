Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:\nBe respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.\nBe constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.\n \nBe sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.\n \nPost appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.\n \nUsers that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.\n \nPlease help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.\n \nIn addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!\n\nFORUM POSTING GUIDELINES\n\nWhat makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:\n \nRead before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.\n \nUse informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.\n \nMake it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.\n \nStay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.\n \nHelp keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff. \n \nThanks for keeping the conversation lively and respectful!",

In Project 3, you are tasked with directly controlling the joint angles using forward kinematics to move the robot between two configurations, while Project 4 uses inverse kinematics and Cartesian control to set the joint angles so that the desired end-effector configuration can be reached.\n\nJust recently in Melbourne, Australia, they started using a similar Kuka robot to scoop ice cream! Here is a video of the robot in action. While watching the video, think about the concepts you learned in this course related to the movement and control of a robot arm. \n\nWhich concepts do you think are being used for this ice cream scooping robot?

Now, given current and desired transforms from the {b} to {ee}, how do we obtain Δx? I want to make the distinction that, per the lectures, Δx should be in the frame of the base coordinate and not the end-effector. Then, v_ee should be in the frame of the end-effector. So, how do we compute these values?\n\nOne option would be to compute the translation component of Δx as $$\\Delta x\\ \\textrm{translation: } ^bT_{ee,desired}[:-1,-1] \\textrm{  } - \\textrm{  } ^bT_{ee,current}[:-1,-1] \\textrm{  ,}$$\n\nand then calculate the rotation component of Δx using the method from Project 2. [i.e. Compute the axis-angle representations of the current and desired rotations from the given transforms. Then determine the angle around an axis in the base frame {b} needed to get this desired change by using the cross product and dot product between these two rotation axes.] With both components obtained, separate proportionality factors can be applied for thresholding, giving $$\\dot{x} = p \\cdot \\Delta x \\textrm{ .}$$\n\nThen, to determine dx in the frame of the end-effector, calculate $$v_{ee}=\\left[\\begin{matrix}^{ee}R_b&0\\\\0&^{ee}R_b\\end{matrix}\\right]\\cdot\\dot{x}\\text{ ,}$$\n\nusing the rotation component of $$^bT_{ee,current}^{-1} \\textrm{ to obtain } ^{ee}R_b \\textrm{ .}$$\n\nThis can then be used to determine the joint velocities necessary to move the robot arm using the Jacobian and it's pseudo-inverse.QUESTION: should the rotation component used above be from the current transformation (as shown above), or should it come from the desired transformation of the end-effector?\n\n\n\nOption two, however, seems like the more obvious method to compute the transform from the current pose of the end-effector to its desired pose using$$^{ee,current}T_{ee,desired}=^bT_{ee,current}^{-1}\\cdot^bT_{ee,desired} \\textrm{  ,}$$\n\nwhich is in the frame of the end-effector automatically; this gives a 4x4 transformation matrix. This then skips the conversion from $$\\Delta x\\ \\ \\ \\longrightarrow\\ \\ \\ \\dot{x}$$\n\nas we are already in the end-effector frame {ee}. Then, the translation component of dx can be read directly from this. The rotation component of dx can be computed in euler angles from the rotation component of this transform using tf.transformations.euler_from_matrix\n\nfrom the TF library and similar calls from previous projects. With these values obtained, one can then apply separate proportionality factors to meet threshold requirements for the translation and rotation parts to give final value v_ee.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have tried implementing both methods and appear to be getting eradicate behavior of the robot arm - even with valid matrix values for transforms and the Jacobian - and it does not follow the cartesian control asked for. It is possible that my thresholding is too low/too high, but I think it might be something wrong with my understanding of calculating v_ee.\n\nAre either of the above two methods correct or is my understanding flawed in some capacity?\n\n\n\nThank you for any input and help with my understanding.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I closed the software, wrote down my credentials, and attempted to restart the test, but it appears on EdX has that the exam has already started, and the exam timer is counting down. However, I cannot access the questions because the proctoring software is requiring me to re-enter the exam code, which I cannot access because EdX thinks I am currently taking the test. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nJohn",
