Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:\nBe respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.\nBe constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.\n \nBe sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.\n \nPost appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.\n \nUsers that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.\n \nPlease help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.\n \nIn addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!\n\nFORUM POSTING GUIDELINES\n\nWhat makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:\n \nRead before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.\n \nUse informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.\n \nMake it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.\n \nStay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.\n \nHelp keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff. \n \nThanks for keeping the conversation lively and respectful!",

Alhough the title of the course sounds very cute, you all may have realized by now that the material isn't as cuddly as it seemed. I took this course last year and I can tell you that it was one the hardest course I've ever took. I came into the class not knowing C++ or linear algebra, but thanks to the help of my TAs and my peers I was able to not only get through the class, but now I'm also here, TAing the course! Please try to create a community here in the discussion where everyone feels confident asking questions, and I hope you all try to help answer each other's questions. Here are a few tips and tricks from me, that I wish I knew when I started this course:\n\n\n\n\nI highly recommend using Git. Sometimes (especially in future assignments) files can get so long and different classes can depend on each other so much that changing one line somewhere might cause you to fail the oracle. However, I must ask that if you plan to use it with GitHub to use private repos. The material in this course is dense and so we can't afford to come up with new content for every semester that comes along. If you post it on GitHub, future students might just stumble across it, and that will ruin their opportunity to learn by themselves.\n\nGive yourself a lot of time to do the assignments. For some of you without a very strong math or physics background, staring at a 10 page prompt full of derivations and equations might seem intimidating. Start early, give yourself time for the material to sink in.\n\n\nIf you haven't already, you should familiarize yourself with the Eigen library. Some of the functions in there will make your code much easier to read and debug. Specifically, take a look at block functions, as you'll be using them the most.\n\n\nUse the discussion board! If you don't understand a certain concept in the write up, please make a post on the discussion board. If you don't understand it on the write up, it will be that much harder when you're trying to debug.\n\n\nIn my opinion, one of the most useful resources we provide to get you started is the FAQ document. This is a collection of tips, tricks and other goodies picked up from the TAs experience for all the assignments. You can find the document at Course > Learning Materials > FAQ. I recommend skimming through the document before starting the first assignment.\n\nLastly, be nice to each other :)\n\n\nGood luck with the course!",

Suppose that both points are moving only horizontally, with velocities v1=90 and v2=110; that is, both points are moving in the same general direction, but with different speeds. We argue that the dashpot decreases the energy of the system because f1 opposes v1, and f2 opposes v2.

Does this mean that the force vector is parallel to v1 (the velocity vector?) \n\nAny explanations or ways to visualize this scenario and build intuition would be much appreciated.",

Please refer below for the prerequisites for each course.\n\nAlthough you could take all courses at once, there is a natural progression in the MicroMasters courses: AI goes well with ML, Robotics with Animation.\n\nFor students who are eager to complete the MicroMasters, we recommend you to take a combination of AI and ML in one session and Robotics and Animation and CGI in another because AI introduces some concepts that will be featured in ML while Robotic tends to have a lighter course load compared to the heavy course load in Animation and CGI, which serves as a great complement. Each course is offered twice a year, once in the Fall (Sep-Dec) and once in the Spring (Feb-May).\n\nHere is a breakdown of prerequisites for each course:\n\nAI: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, derivatives), Calculus, Basic probability theory, Python programming\n\nML: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, derivatives), Calculus, Basic probability theory, Python programming\n\nRobotics: Linear algebra, Knowledge of Linux environment, Python\n\nAnimation and CGI:  Multi-variable calculus, linear algebra, C++, knowledge to navigate a large codebase\n\nNo matter which study path you choose, rest assured that there will be plenty of learning materials and your course staff and classmates will be very willing to help!\n\n\n\nYou can make any necessary changes pertaining to your class.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Given an initial condition of a static spring system with a uniform potential energy field (we can also think of this as the system having no potential energy for the sake of this question, the most important point is that nothing is accelerating w.r.t each other), the only way you would induce a spring force onto either of the particles is if you alter the distance between the two particles, but since in this case, it is a uniform force, the distance between the particles do not change. Therefore the displacement of the spring does not change. Therefore the spring's potential energy does not change. \n\nNote that if it is a non- uniform force field that you're applying to the system, it doesn't matter the magnitude of the force field.

        "document": "<document version=\"1.0\"><paragraph>Given an initial condition of a static spring system with a uniform potential energy field (we can also think of this as the system having no potential energy for the sake of this question, the most important point is that nothing is accelerating w.r.t each other), the only way you would induce a spring force onto either of the particles is if you alter the distance between the two particles, but since in this case, it is a uniform force, the distance between the particles do not change. Therefore the displacement of the spring does not change. Therefore the spring's potential energy does not change. </paragraph><paragraph>Note that if it is a non- uniform force field that you're applying to the system, it doesn't matter the magnitude of the force field.

This decreases the complexity of the scene, so you know that if after you remove a feature from the scene and then scene works, then that feature's implementation in your code is not there yet.\n\nAnother way to debug is to change some parameters inside the scene, to see if that causes it to succeed. Usually, accumulation of tiny little errors in some pipeline in your engine would cause this, so you would track down how that parameter affects the flow of your program, then search for the bug there.",

How do I collect for the powers of t in Wolfram? As I understand it, I need to get to the coefficients of t^4, t^3, etc. The problem is that the dot products have got the scalar t embedded in them. So one cannot simply combine them. Doing \"Collect\" in Wolfram simply returns the same expression.

You do not need to use normals in your calculations / derivations\n\n3. It seems that students from previous years also had a similar issue where their derivation yielded the correct results for the two sample cases, but failed the ContinuousTimeTests.\n\nThe issue seems to stem from the formula for the quartic position polynomial. For example, there seems to be a difference between $a \\cdot (b+c+\\cdots)$ vs  $a \\cdot b + a \\cdot c + \\cdots$). Most likely, there is some floating point inprecision that can add up to exceed the oracle's allowed error threshold. If possible, I would try rearranging your formulas a bit and see if that helps!",

In this connection, I have the following questions: \n\n\n\nIn the FAQ, there is a link to an article on SymPy. The article mostly talks about working with gradients and I was not immediately able to make a connection to my situation. Are we doing anything related to Symbolic Differentiation here (for the derivation of the quartic expression as well as for the derivation of the formula for the particle-halfplane polynomials)? As I understand it what we're doing is simply symbolic simplification of an expression. Is my assumption correct? \n\nThe way I understand the above mentioned article is like this: the purpose of the article is to give an idea about common subexpression elimination (using sympy.cse). When I generated my code using Mathematica, I landed up with incredibly long expressions that are hard to debug. Using common subexpression elimination in SymPy should help reduce these expressions to more manageable expressions that are similar to the quintic formula. Is this assumption correct?\n\nHow do you declare a vector as a symbol in Sympy? If we do something like this we get an error: \n\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\n>>> x.dot(y)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nAttributeError: 'Symbol' object has no attribute 'dot'\n\n\nAnd in my review of the matrices module, I could not find any way to declare a vector as a pure symbol (i.e. without allocating elements into the matrix). Any pointers would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks",

As I understand it what we're doing is simply symbolic simplification of an expression. Is my assumption correct? </paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>The way I understand the above mentioned article is like this: the purpose of the article is to give an idea about common subexpression elimination (using sympy.cse). When I generated my code using Mathematica, I landed up with incredibly long expressions that are hard to debug. Using common subexpression elimination in SymPy should help reduce these expressions to more manageable expressions that are similar to the quintic formula. Is this assumption correct?</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>How do you declare a vector as a symbol in Sympy? If we do something like this we get an error: </paragraph><pre>x, y, z = symbols('x y z')\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x.dot(y)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"&lt;string&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nAttributeError: 'Symbol' object has no attribute 'dot'\n</pre><paragraph>And in my review of the <link href=\"https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/matrices/matrices.html\">matrices</link> module, I could not find any way to declare a vector as a pure symbol (i.e. without allocating elements into the matrix). Any pointers would be much appreciated.</paragraph></list-item></list><paragraph>Thanks</paragraph></document>",

I did and got the same white screen failure when selecting log in via google. I decided to restart my computer and I reset my EdX password so I could log in without needing to go through the google link. But now I am no longer able to even get to the log in screen on the secure browser because I no longer have the exam code. When I select the final exam in the course to get the code it thinks I am in the middle of taking the exam and asks me to return to the RPN software and my 3 hours are counting down.\n\nI either need the exam code or need to submit an empty exam and get it re-opened.

I decided to restart my computer and I reset my EdX password so I could log in without needing to go through the google link. But now I am no longer able to even get to the log in screen on the secure browser because I no longer have the exam code. When I select the final exam in the course to get the code it thinks I am in the middle of taking the exam and asks me to return to the RPN software and my 3 hours are counting down.</paragraph><paragraph>I either need the exam code or need to submit an empty exam and get it re-opened.

I wrote to PSI support team, Edx support team (Ayesha Murtaza replied) and to Course Staff (Abby(sh3146)  replied) regarding this issue before the exam. But none of that attempt addressed my issue properly. PSI support team told me if there's an issue with my practice proctored exam they'll let me know. But they didn't reply or gave a follow-up mail. So I went and bought an expensive stand-alone webcam with high resolution and focus feature and used that side standing webcam to do the final proctored exam. I took all the steps to my level best to adhere to the PSI rules. I'm from Sri Lanka which is the third world country where we can't guaranty the uninterrupted supply of Current and Intenet Connection.

I'm always ready to take the exam again to prove my genuineness and potential. But please clearly state me what was the issue with my proctored exam? Was it my webcam quality is not satisfactory? Or was it I used a side stand webcam? Or any other reason. Just plainly giving a reply as stated above is so frustrating and it is of no help in improving the exam condition in the next sit.

This course already cost me the Course money $275 (which is huge when compared with my monthly salary which is $543.47) + a brand new webcam for $40 and one working day. Please consider all these facts into consideration and give me a solution either to retake the exam or clearing the hold on my previous exam result as soon as possible as the course ends on December 24th. I'm hopefully waiting for your kind reply. Thanks for your time and considerations.",

Let me explain how the proctor software works and what the suspicious behavior means. \n\n In a proctored exam, there are a lot of algorithms added based on the exam instructions. For example, if the books or notes are allowed or not. Can students use calculators etc? The software would apply those algorithms in addition to the basic appropriate exam behaviors such as not leaving the room, not wearing headphones, not looking away from the screen, etc. If any of those behaviors are detected, learners would be marked as having suspicious behavior(s). Then, a human proctor will investigate and decide if this is a violation. Later, it will go through an internal evaluation and you will be notified of the reason why you violated the exam. \n\nThat says, there is no need for you to be panic. You can wait for the feedback on the initial analysis of your proctored exam. You will also have a chance to petition for your case. The instructional team will weigh in and provide feedback. So, if you follow the exam rules, you do not need to worry. Hope this explains what does the email means. \n\n\nSince you already finish all the coursework, assignments and exams before the 23rd of December, you already fulfilled your duty. You do not need to worry if the investigation past the course due date. That doesn't affect your credentials. \n\nLast but not least, we really appreciate your time with us and hope you benefit from the lecture and assignments. Apologize again for the hassle of the final exam, we are definitely in contact with edX to improve on the learners' experience. The discussion forum is still open and you can still reach us here.

            "text": "Dear Course Staff,\n\nI've done the proctored exam genuinely by accomplishing all the PSI rules and regulations and scored 25.2/30.0. But today I received the following message, \" Your proctored exam \"Final Exam\" in Animation and CGI Motion was reviewed and the team identified one or more violations of the proctored exam rules. Examples of issues that may result in a rules violation include browsing the internet, blurry or missing photo identification, using a phone, or getting help from another person. As a result of the identified issue(s), you did not successfully meet the proctored exam requirements.\" \nIt was so surprising and causing great mental agony to me. I was genuine and true to address the issue I had with the quality of my laptop webcam one day before I sat for the final exam. I wrote to PSI support team, Edx support team (Ayesha Murtaza replied) and to Course Staffs regarding this issue before the exam. But none addressed my issue properly. PSI support team told me if there's an issue with my practice proctored exam they'll let me know. But they didn't reply or gave a follow-up mail. So I went and bought an expensive stand-alone webcam with high resolution and focus feature and used that side standing webcam to do the final proctored exam. I took all the steps to my level best to adhere to the PSI rules. I'm from Sri Lanka which is the third world country where we can't guaranty the uninterrupted supply of Current and Intenet Connection. So I talk with the local Electricity Board and made sure that power will be on for the three hours of my proctored exam. I wrote the exam at midnight so that no surrounding noise pollution (Sound from the village Temple speakers, Sound from the Local shop speaker advertising, etc) in order to adhere to the PSI sound level. Now simply PSI inspection makes me guilty. This is not fair and also it is inhuman for a person who had tried his level best to qualify for certification in all the genuine way from a third world country where none of the university provides courses related to Computer Graphics. I'm always ready to take the exam again to prove my genuineness and potential. But please clearly state me what was the issue with my proctored exam? Was it my webcam quality is not satisfactory? Or was it I used a side stand webcam? Or any other reason. Just plainly giving a reply as stated above is so frustrating and it is of no help in improving the exam condition in the next sit. Please kindly be clear and specific regarding the issue which caused the proctored exam violation. Please take into consideration that when I take the exam again, I have to go through all the procedures from confirming the Electricity and the Internet is uninterrupted. And I have to write the exam at midnight (for the sound level) which comes at the cost of my next day's office work.

            "document": "<document version=\"2.0\"><paragraph>Dear Course Staff,</paragraph><paragraph>I've done the proctored exam genuinely by accomplishing all the PSI rules and regulations and scored 25.2/30.0. But today I received the following message, \" Your proctored exam \"Final Exam\" in Animation and CGI Motion was reviewed and the team identified one or more violations of the proctored exam rules. Examples of issues that may result in a rules violation include browsing the internet, blurry or missing photo identification, using a phone, or getting help from another person. As a result of the identified issue(s), you did not successfully meet the proctored exam requirements.\" <break/>It was so surprising and causing great mental agony to me. I was genuine and true to address the issue I had with the quality of my laptop webcam one day before I sat for the final exam. I wrote to PSI support team, Edx support team (Ayesha Murtaza replied) and to Course Staffs regarding this issue before the exam. But none addressed my issue properly. PSI support team told me if there's an issue with my practice proctored exam they'll let me know. But they didn't reply or gave a follow-up mail. So I went and bought an expensive stand-alone webcam with high resolution and focus feature and used that side standing webcam to do the final proctored exam. I took all the steps to my level best to adhere to the PSI rules. I'm from Sri Lanka which is the third world country where we can't guaranty the uninterrupted supply of Current and Intenet Connection. So I talk with the local Electricity Board and made sure that power will be on for the three hours of my proctored exam. I wrote the exam at midnight so that no surrounding noise pollution (Sound from the village Temple speakers, Sound from the Local shop speaker advertising, etc) in order to adhere to the PSI sound level. Now simply PSI inspection makes me guilty. This is not fair and also it is inhuman for a person who had tried his level best to qualify for certification in all the genuine way from a third world country where none of the university provides courses related to Computer Graphics. I'm always ready to take the exam again to prove my genuineness and potential. But please clearly state me what was the issue with my proctored exam? Was it my webcam quality is not satisfactory? Or was it I used a side stand webcam? Or any other reason. Just plainly giving a reply as stated above is so frustrating and it is of no help in improving the exam condition in the next sit. Please kindly be clear and specific regarding the issue which caused the proctored exam violation. Please take into consideration that when I take the exam again, I have to go through all the procedures from confirming the Electricity and the Internet is uninterrupted. And I have to write the exam at midnight (for the sound level) which comes at the cost of my next day's office work. This course already cost me the Course money $275 (which is huge when compared with my monthly salary which is $543.47) + a brand new webcam for $40 and one working day. Please consider all these facts into consideration and give me a solution either to retake the exam or clearing the hold on my previous exam result as soon as possible as the course ends on December 24th. I'm hopefully waiting for your kind reply. Thanks for your time and considerations.</paragraph></document>",

I spent at least 20 hours a week on the course and I suspect a majority of course participants also spent many more hours a week than the advertised 8 to 10 hours per week. \n\nAllow for part marks on assignments. A student must be able to get marks on assignments in smaller segments  rather than the do-or-die kind of scenario that we're currently thrust into. This can be achieved by having more test cases on assignments so that students can slowly build their understanding with fewer assumptions (i.e. allow for implementation formula by formula)\n\nHave (ungraded) formative assessments to help students test and strengthen their understanding / intuition and map out their weaknesses.\n\nHave a clear section on symbolic algebra (CAS) where we are taught how to move from 1D representations of equations to 2D representations. \n\nProvide a formula sheet so users can take away something at the end of the course\n\nPlease feel free to add to this list or discuss.

I spent at least 20 hours a week on the course and I suspect a majority of course participants also spent many more hours a week than the advertised 8 to 10 hours per week. </paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Allow for part marks on assignments. A student must be able to get marks on assignments in smaller segments  rather than the do-or-die kind of scenario that we're currently thrust into. This can be achieved by having more test cases on assignments so that students can slowly build their understanding with fewer assumptions (i.e. allow for implementation formula by formula)</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Have (ungraded) formative assessments to help students test and strengthen their understanding / intuition and map out their weaknesses.</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Have a clear section on symbolic algebra (CAS) where we are taught how to move from 1D representations of equations to 2D representations. </paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Provide a formula sheet so users can take away something at the end of the course</paragraph></list-item></list><paragraph>Please feel free to add to this list or discuss. </paragraph></document>",
