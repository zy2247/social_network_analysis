    "text": "Discussion forum Guideline: \nThe discussion forums are a way for you to share your thoughts about course material, learn from your fellow students, get to know them better, and report problems.\nIf you have an urgent matter -- such as needing to report a video or other course component that isn't working properly -- you can get the attention of course staff by creating a new post and putting [STAFF] in the title.\n \nThere are a few other ways you can participate:\n \nSelect the \"heart\" icon to like  posts and good responses (so the post will move closer to the top of the discussion thread)\n \nSelect the “star” icon to follow posts for updates\n \nUse “watch” to be notified of all activities in the thread\n \nYou are part of a diverse learning community that forms the heart of a meaningful learning experience. Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:\nBe respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.\nBe constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.\n \nBe sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.\n \nPost appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.\n \nUsers that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.\n \nPlease help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.\n \nIn addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!\n\nFORUM POSTING GUIDELINES\n\nWhat makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:\n \nRead before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.\n \nUse informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.\n \nMake it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.\n \nStay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.\n \nHelp keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff. \n \nThanks for keeping the conversation lively and respectful!",

Is this correct/enough? \n\n2.  Then for all those values, I select the 10 that are the highest and return the list of indices corresponding from highest to lowest values of sigma naught squared and here are some of my questions:\n\n\n\nLet's suppose that there are three equal values of sigma naught squared and the indices are 1, 5 and 7 does the order matter? Or should there not be any repeated values (of sigma naught squared) because that means it is actually the same observation? If so, which one should remain?\n\nI think these are the 2 big parts of this problem and so far I haven't been able to identify on which one I'm lacking to improve my implementation of the lectures. Or if it is an output that I'm not presenting correctly, I would like to know how to interpret the 6/10 if it means that I've had 6 datasets correct out of 10, or if it means that in general, my results present a 60% \"correctness\" to the actual result in average for all datasets tested in my program. \n\nThanks in advance!",

Active learning is often used, say, when labelled data points are expensive to come by.  Depending on the required objective function, the formula for picking that next data point may be different -- but this general approach is still called active learning. The lecture discusses a particular objective function (linear regression prediction), which generates a specific formula that should be used for implementing an active learning strategy. Again, if we required or imposed a different objective function, then that would imply different formulas to use in active learning.\n  Not sure if I interpreted your question correctly, if not, please clarify.",

Depending on the required objective function, the formula for picking that next data point may be different -- but this general approach is still called active learning. The lecture discusses a particular objective function (linear regression prediction), which generates a specific formula that should be used for implementing an active learning strategy. Again, if we required or imposed a different objective function, then that would imply different formulas to use in active learning.<break/>  Not sure if I interpreted your question correctly, if not, please clarify.</paragraph></document>",

In each iteration do not forget to update/recompute the covariance matrix (big sigma) $\\Sigma = (\\lambda I + \\sigma^{-2}X^{T}X)^{-1}$ as your measured $X$ changes at each iteration when you add a selected observation to it. That's the whole point here of updating posteriors sequentially. The small sigma parameter $\\sigma^{2}$ does not change!\n\n\n\nTip2. Observe that if you remove the selected observation $x_{0}$ from the so far unmeasured set $X_{new}$ then you change its indexes so you need to somehow keep track of the original ones. The easiest way in my opinion is to not remove the selected observation and just make sure you do not select the same row more than once.\n\n\n\nTip3. Don't forget to return the finally selected indexes on \"start with 1\" basis.",

Observe that if you remove the selected observation $x_{0}$ from the so far unmeasured set $X_{new}$ then you change its indexes so you need to somehow keep track of the original ones. The easiest way in my opinion is to not remove the selected observation and just make sure you do not select the same row more than once.</paragraph><paragraph/><paragraph><bold>Tip3</bold>. Don't forget to return the finally selected indexes on \"start with 1\" basis.</paragraph></document>",

A couple of days ago, I submitted code that I knew would only do the U and V matrices (I set L to zeros, this was my 5th submission if you want to check it out). I was really surprised when I got 15/15 for the objective function (which I knew was obviously wrong) and 0/10 for the user-object locations (which I at least hoped would be correct). I drew the conclusion that the labels had been switched and thought no more of it until today.\n\nToday I added code for calculating the objective L, without changing the previous code. Strangely,  I now got 8.27/15 on the objective function and 9.99999.../10 on the user-object locations. By deliberately making an error in the calculation of the objective function, I saw that the grade dropped from 8.27/15 to 7.65/15, which, contrary to what I thought previously, seems to imply that the labeling is fine. To summarize, this raises the following questions:\n\n\n\n How was it possible to get 15/15 for just setting L = 0 yesterday, and 8.27/15 when I tried to calculate it correctly today?\n\nWhy did I get 0/10 for V and U yesterday, and 9.99999.../10 today for the same code?\n\nFinally, as others have asked, will we get a bonus for submitting before Nov 24? I did not get any bonus points.\n\nHope you have time to look into this!\n\nNikolay",
