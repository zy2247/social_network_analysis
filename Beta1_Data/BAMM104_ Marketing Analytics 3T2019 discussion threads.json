Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:\nBe respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.\nBe constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.\n \nBe sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.\n \nPost appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.\n \nUsers that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.\n \nPlease help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.\n \nIn addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!\n\nFORUM POSTING GUIDELINES\n\nWhat makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:\n \nRead before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.\n \nUse informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.\n \nMake it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.\n \nStay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.\n \nHelp keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff. \n \nThanks for keeping the conversation lively and respectful!",

Then we have customers rated different brands on those attributes. We can use the same method to relate customer perceived value to lifestyle. For example, getting up early, doing exercise every day, reading a book every week, etc can be the attributes for lifestyles. Customers will give different importance scores on those attributes and we also have different lifestyles like ourdoorsy, austere, nomatic, etc. Then we can relate customers values with those lifestyles by giving scores on their attributes.\n\n\nCases in this course are mainly for product marketing. The lifestyle is more like a concept than a product or we can relate a product to a lifestyle. The instructors will go step by step to teach how to do customer segementation and target marketing.\n\nBest,\n\nEvelyn",

    "text": "This is a post shared by a student who successfully completed a proctored final exam:\n\nLet me share my experience on the PSI Secure Browser.  As many had encountered, I also got the \"bandwidth\" issue which reason was identified by the Secure Software support.  My resolution was 1) to use more powerful CPU, 2) to use lower resolution display,  and 3) to avoid using a PDF reader.\n\nWhen I took the practice exam with Dell XPS 13 (screen resolution: 3200x1800), the practice was so smooth, and I did not get any issues.  At that time I did not use any other software (as PSI Secure Browser request the confirmation to kill such software), did not browse any other material including Columbia University webpages.  I thought I have no issue with that testing environment.\n\nI took the final exam on Tuesday in the original final week.  I used the same PC in the same wired network environment (which I later measured upstream at 300Mbps, downstream at 700Mbps).  This time I tried to use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to view my notes and the handouts in digital form.  At the 2nd question I wanted to confirm the answer on the handout, and started to flip pages.  Then I was kicked out of the exam.  I contacted the Secure Software and got to know that the reason of disconnection was insufficient bandwidth, which seems a little weird.\n\nI thought it might be the nature of the PSI Secure Browser, because such software should be used also at real test center typically carrying out closed-book tests.  If so, it needs to detect cheating through running other software.  Although the use PDF reader is allowed in our case, running some other software might be affecting in a bad way.  The browser also reminded me at the booting time that it uploads the image from webcam, and all the activity on the screen is recorded.  So it would make sense to think that the use of PDF reader became a big load for the laptop's CPU to compress such higher resolution screen to upload, and it would be possible that such load resulted and/or was detected as insufficient bandwidth.\n\nBased on that assumption, when I retook the exam, I prepared a box PC with a powerful CPU and more memory.  I connected a full-HD (1920x1080) display instead of one with higher resolution.  I also prepared my notes and the handouts in physical form to avoid the use of the PDF reader.

As many had encountered, I also got the \"bandwidth\" issue which reason was identified by the Secure Software support.  My resolution was 1) to use more powerful CPU, 2) to use lower resolution display,  and 3) to avoid using a PDF reader.</paragraph><paragraph>When I took the practice exam with Dell XPS 13 (screen resolution: 3200x1800), the practice was so smooth, and I did not get any issues.  At that time I did not use any other software (as PSI Secure Browser request the confirmation to kill such software), did not browse any other material including Columbia University webpages.  I thought I have no issue with that testing environment.</paragraph><paragraph>I took the final exam on Tuesday in the original final week.  I used the same PC in the same wired network environment (which I later measured upstream at 300Mbps, downstream at 700Mbps).  This time I tried to use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to view my notes and the handouts in digital form.  At the 2nd question I wanted to confirm the answer on the handout, and started to flip pages.  Then I was kicked out of the exam.  I contacted the Secure Software and got to know that the reason of disconnection was insufficient bandwidth, which seems a little weird.</paragraph><paragraph>I thought it might be the nature of the PSI Secure Browser, because such software should be used also at real test center typically carrying out closed-book tests.  If so, it needs to detect cheating through running other software.  Although the use PDF reader is allowed in our case, running some other software might be affecting in a bad way.  The browser also reminded me at the booting time that it uploads the image from webcam, and all the activity on the screen is recorded.  So it would make sense to think that the use of PDF reader became a big load for the laptop's CPU to compress such higher resolution screen to upload, and it would be possible that such load resulted and/or was detected as insufficient bandwidth.</paragraph><paragraph>Based on that assumption, when I retook the exam, I prepared a box PC with a powerful CPU and more memory.  I connected a full-HD (1920x1080) display instead of one with higher resolution.  I also prepared my notes and the handouts in physical form to avoid the use of the PDF reader.  It was a very good experience to take the proctored exam which went so smooth until the end of the exam.  I really enjoyed the final exam.</paragraph><paragraph/></document>",
