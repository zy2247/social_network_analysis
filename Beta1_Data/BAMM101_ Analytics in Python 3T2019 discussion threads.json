Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:\nBe respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.\nBe constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.\n \nBe sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.\n \nPost appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.\n \nUsers that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.\n \nPlease help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.\n \nIn addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!\n\nFORUM POSTING GUIDELINES\n\nWhat makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:\n \nRead before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.\n \nUse informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.\n \nMake it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.\n \nStay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.\n \nHelp keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff. \n \nThanks for keeping the conversation lively and respectful!",

In both cases I don't get the mark for the Status test.\n\nTherefore I suspect there is something wrong with your grader, that impacts some other questions as well.\n\nCould you please review.\n\nNB: your exercise is kind of short of explanations about what is clearly expected from the grader, and it seems we have to do a lot of 2nd guessing.

I thought that this specific program would not only provide me with the opportunity to learn Python, but also to learn and practice its very practical uses for business analytics. I am just now getting into the workforce, and, although I am not sure I will be going into business analytics specifically , I believe the courses will equip me with the knowledge and set of skills to apply these programs/concepts into other types of analytics. Well, I certainly hope it does--but I am getting this impression so far :)\n\nRegarding the timeline, I would very much like to take all the courses within one year--but this is due to personal goals rather than time constraints. However, I see that the sessions for the 4 courses have gaps of a couple of months between them. Maybe it is because, at this time, each course only has two sessions available for sign up. \n\nSince I have never learned Python, I thought it would be most beneficial for me to take this course by itself first. This way, I can actually learn the workings of Python before I delve into the many many things we will do with it in the later courses. Basically, I wanted to take this course prior to starting the others so that I can take the most out of each one. As for the other ones, although I will certainly be learning new things, it will be a less steep learning curve, as I am quite familiar with statistics, supply/demand, models, and other analytical frameworks. So, I guess maybe I could take two courses at once when I take the other courses. My only concern is that, by that time I start the next courses I will be working (well, I certainly hope), and will consequently not have as much time to focus on the courses.\n\nDo you have any information regarding the timing of the other course sessions that will be released soon? Or, if I would definitely need to complete two courses at once in order to complete the entire program within one year?\n\nI know I shared a lot, but I wanted to give you the full picture of my situation, so you may assess it and give me any advice, insight, or feedback that you may have!\n\nThank you so much in advance for your time and attention!",

As you can see I worked with punctuations and excluded some punctuations. This seems not correct. With x.isalpha I can separate the string in two lists, one just with words which are alphabetical and the other list with words with punctuations. No I basically need a loop to check the last character of each word and if the last character is a punctuation it should be removed. But here I am stuck. Can you please check?  So I need to separate my list in each word like builing a new string and then checking for the last character? Thanks a lot.",

Using the full data to train the model is fine as far as this assignment concerns. \n\nBut for real life problems, for sure, you will need to do that. In fact, you not only need to split the whole dataset into train and test dataset, but also split the train dataset further into train and validation dataset for cross-validation. \n\nRegarding what fraction you need to give for the splitting, I think it depends on the size of your data. If your data is very large, you could give a smaller fraction for your test dataset, and vice versa. Normally, 15% - 20% test data should be sufficient. \n\nNaili",

You can use Q-Q plot to check various things, but one of its main use is to check whether or not a distribution is normal. \n\nAs you can see from the graph above, we can use a normal Q-Q plot to check a sample distribution's normality.

As many had encountered, I also got the \"bandwidth\" issue which reason was identified by the Secure Software support.  My resolution was 1) to use more powerful CPU, 2) to use lower resolution display,  and 3) to avoid using a PDF reader.\n\nWhen I took the practice exam with Dell XPS 13 (screen resolution: 3200x1800), the practice was so smooth, and I did not get any issues.  At that time I did not use any other software (as PSI Secure Browser request the confirmation to kill such software), did not browse any other material including Columbia University webpages.  I thought I have no issue with that testing environment.\n\nI took the final exam on Tuesday in the original final week.  I used the same PC in the same wired network environment (which I later measured upstream at 300Mbps, downstream at 700Mbps).  This time I tried to use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to view my notes and the handouts in digital form.  At the 2nd question I wanted to confirm the answer on the handout, and started to flip pages.  Then I was kicked out of the exam.  I contacted the Secure Software and got to know that the reason of disconnection was insufficient bandwidth, which seems a little weird.\n\nI thought it might be the nature of the PSI Secure Browser, because such software should be used also at real test center typically carrying out closed-book tests.  If so, it needs to detect cheating through running other software.  Although the use PDF reader is allowed in our case, running some other software might be affecting in a bad way.  The browser also reminded me at the booting time that it uploads the image from webcam, and all the activity on the screen is recorded.  So it would make sense to think that the use of PDF reader became a big load for the laptop's CPU to compress such higher resolution screen to upload, and it would be possible that such load resulted and/or was detected as insufficient bandwidth.\n\nBased on that assumption, when I retook the exam, I prepared a box PC with a powerful CPU and more memory.  I connected a full-HD (1920x1080) display instead of one with higher resolution.  I also prepared my notes and the handouts in physical form to avoid the use of the PDF reader.  It was a very good experience to take the proctored exam which went so smooth until the end of the exam.  I really enjoyed the final exam.",

As many had encountered, I also got the \"bandwidth\" issue which reason was identified by the Secure Software support.  My resolution was 1) to use more powerful CPU, 2) to use lower resolution display,  and 3) to avoid using a PDF reader.\n\nWhen I took the practice exam with Dell XPS 13 (screen resolution: 3200x1800), the practice was so smooth, and I did not get any issues.  At that time I did not use any other software (as PSI Secure Browser request the confirmation to kill such software), did not browse any other material including Columbia University webpages.  I thought I have no issue with that testing environment.\n\nI took the final exam on Tuesday in the original final week.  I used the same PC in the same wired network environment (which I later measured upstream at 300Mbps, downstream at 700Mbps).  This time I tried to use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to view my notes and the handouts in digital form.  At the 2nd question I wanted to confirm the answer on the handout, and started to flip pages.  Then I was kicked out of the exam.  I contacted the Secure Software and got to know that the reason of disconnection was insufficient bandwidth, which seems a little weird.\n\nI thought it might be the nature of the PSI Secure Browser, because such software should be used also at real test center typically carrying out closed-book tests.  If so, it needs to detect cheating through running other software.  Although the use PDF reader is allowed in our case, running some other software might be affecting in a bad way.  The browser also reminded me at the booting time that it uploads the image from webcam, and all the activity on the screen is recorded.  So it would make sense to think that the use of PDF reader became a big load for the laptop's CPU to compress such higher resolution screen to upload, and it would be possible that such load resulted and/or was detected as insufficient bandwidth.\n\nBased on that assumption, when I retook the exam, I prepared a box PC with a powerful CPU and more memory.  I connected a full-HD (1920x1080) display instead of one with higher resolution.  I also prepared my notes and the handouts in physical form to avoid the use of the PDF reader.  It was a very good experience to take the proctored exam which went so smooth until the end of the exam.  I really enjoyed the final exam.",
