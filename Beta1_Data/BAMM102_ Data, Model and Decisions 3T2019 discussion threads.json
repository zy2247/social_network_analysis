Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:\nBe respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.\nBe constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.\n \nBe sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.\n \nPost appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.\n \nUsers that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.\n \nPlease help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.\n \nIn addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!\n\nFORUM POSTING GUIDELINES\n\nWhat makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:\n \nRead before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.\n \nUse informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.\n \nMake it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.\n \nStay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.\n \nHelp keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff. \n \nThanks for keeping the conversation lively and respectful!",

    "text": "Hi All,\n\nI just need a small clarification for Regression Analysis quiz week 4. The question is to find the 95% confidence interval for the variable PROMOTE. Fortunately, my value was closer to the choices given when I used Z-distribution confidence interval values and I got it right. But when I see the solved solution, I could see that it uses t-distribution confidence interval value. The number of observations given is more than 30. Then why there is a need to use t instead of Z ? \n\n\n\nThank you in advance\n\nSrihari Mohan",

        "text": "Hi Srihari,\n\n\n\nThe general rule is when the number of samples is small, we should use Student's t-distribution, and when the number of samples is large, we should use z-distribution. The underlying reason is when the number of samples becomes large enough, t-distribution approaches z-distribution.\n\n\n\nIn your question, although N > 30, the t-distribution should still be precise, so we provide the correct choice by t-distribution. Meanwhile, as you mentioned, your answer is close to the correct choice. This is not coincidence, as t-distribution becomes sufficiently close to z-distribution. In our assignments and exams, we will consider both t-distribution and z-distribution as correct answers when N > 30 unless specifically informed in the problem.\n\n\n\nFor your information (the technical details here are not required in this course), the main difference is that we do not know the population s.d., so we need to estimate by the s.e. of the sample. That's why t-distribution should be applied when the number of samples is small. You can find more details here.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nFred",

How can this be? I looked at the output of the decision variables using both methods and they are both different thereby creating different optimal schedules with different optimal objective values.

Quite a wide range of topics . \n\n3. How ever , not at all satisfied with how few topics are explained, specifically  sensitivity analysis , duality theory . Especially , if this course has no much pre requisites and assumes that every person here is new to the topic.\n\n4. I fell short of time to complete the exam . Especially those involving Gurobi Python codes. \n\n30 mins more would suffice. \n\n5. Having time shared the course with my work, fell short of time to practise extra out of the given material. So may be the course duration too needs to be re-looked . \n\n6. Give an option to retry the exam for the sake of those who didn't pass or want to score higher. (with an extra cost if need be ) so that they don't have to redo the entire course. \n\nThese are my sincere feedback , given the fact that many of us who are working hard and putting time in MicroMaster's course , is with a purpose of passing the course (at the least) and to actually be able to learn and apply it in our  future (or current) work. \n\nProviding my inputs here as the course survey was just too short !! :)\n\nThanks to all!\n\nVidya \n\n",

Especially , if this course has no much pre requisites and assumes that every person here is new to the topic.</paragraph><paragraph>4. I fell short of time to complete the exam . Especially those involving Gurobi Python codes. </paragraph><paragraph>30 mins more would suffice. </paragraph><paragraph>5. Having time shared the course with my work, fell short of time to practise extra out of the given material. So may be the course duration too needs to be re-looked . </paragraph><paragraph><bold>6. Give an option to retry the exam for the sake of those who didn't pass or want to score higher. (with an extra cost if need be ) so that they don't have to redo the entire course.</bold> </paragraph><paragraph>These are my sincere feedback , given the fact that many of us who are working hard and putting time in MicroMaster's course , is with a purpose of passing the course (at the least) and to actually be able to learn and apply it in our  future (or current) work. </paragraph><paragraph>Providing my inputs here as the course survey was just too short !! :)</paragraph><paragraph>Thanks to all!</paragraph><paragraph>Vidya </paragraph><paragraph/></document>",
