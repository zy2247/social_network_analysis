Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:\nBe respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.\nBe constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.\n \nBe sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.\n \nPost appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.\n \nUsers that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.\n \nPlease help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.\n \nIn addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!\n\nFORUM POSTING GUIDELINES\n\nWhat makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:\n \nRead before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.\n \nUse informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.\n \nMake it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.\n \nStay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.\n \nHelp keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff. \n \nThanks for keeping the conversation lively and respectful!",

The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:<break/> <break/>Read before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.<break/> <break/>Use informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.<break/> <break/>Make it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.<break/> <break/>Stay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.<break/> <break/><bold>Help keep the site friendly.</bold> Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff. <break/> <break/>Thanks for keeping the conversation lively and respectful!</paragraph></document>",

        "text": "To start with John Searle’s The Chinese Room Argument. Maybe I’m not academic enough but I found it incredibly hard to read (compared to all the other chapters and articles recommended). I felt the closest that made sense to me was the bit that was not agreed on by Searle that “… no neuron in my brain understands English, although my whole brain does.”. I feel that understanding  a language and speaking a language are both functions for a computer, but the assessment and understanding of what is said to and spoken by the computer/robot is much more complex. I feel that at present we’re still far from getting to that high level with AI, but will with time. I do feel though that this non-stop discussing about this one example and statement from Searle brings up Einstein’s statement: \"Problems cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them.” I do feel that harping on this one thing is delaying the whole process of us simply achieving it. \n\nAs regards the threat of AI, I do feel that, other than those programmed to harm, what will be the deciding factor of whether AI will be dangerous or not in the long run (talking now regarding the General AI or Strong AI) is its frame of reference.

        "document": "<document version=\"1.0\"><paragraph>To start with John Searle’s The Chinese Room Argument. Maybe I’m not academic enough but I found it incredibly hard to read (compared to all the other chapters and articles recommended). I felt the closest that made sense to me was the bit that was not agreed on by Searle that “… no neuron in my brain understands English, although my whole brain does.”. I feel that understanding  a language and speaking a language are both functions for a computer, but the assessment and understanding of what is said to and spoken by the computer/robot is much more complex. I feel that at present we’re still far from getting to that high level with AI, but will with time. I do feel though that this non-stop discussing about this one example and statement from Searle brings up Einstein’s statement: \"Problems cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them.” I do feel that harping on this one thing is delaying the whole process of us simply achieving it. </paragraph><paragraph>As regards the threat of AI, I do feel that, other than those programmed to harm, what will be the deciding factor of whether AI will be dangerous or not in the long run (talking now regarding the General AI or Strong AI) is its frame of reference. If it uses systems thinking, humans (as well as animals and the environment) would be part of the system and its objective would be for the whole system (including humans) rather than against humans.

This can be supported by researches and experiment on human driving pattern and how AI programs handle regular and extreme situation.</paragraph><paragraph>From the news, we believe the technology is ready in these few years.  Like the electric cars, it takes years of time to gain the public acceptance and the infrastructure ready.  It may be the same case as autonomous car to take at least 5 to be generally accepted and have a share in the market.</paragraph></document>",

Please refer below for the prerequisites for each course.\n\nAlthough you could take all courses at once, there is a natural progression in the MicroMasters courses: AI goes well with ML, Robotics with Animation.\n\nFor students who are eager to complete the MicroMasters, we recommend you to take a combination of AI and ML in one session and Robotics and Animation and CGI in another because AI introduces some concepts that will be featured in ML while Robotic tends to have a lighter course load compared to the heavy course load in Animation and CGI, which serves as a great complement. Each course is offered twice a year, once in the Fall (Sep-Dec) and once in the Spring (Feb-May).\n\nHere is a breakdown of prerequisites for each course:\n\n\n\nAI: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, derivatives), Calculus, Basic probability theory, Python programming\n\nML: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, derivatives), Calculus, Basic probability theory, Python programming\n\nRobotics: Linear algebra, Knowledge of Linux environment, Python\n\nAnimation and CGI:  Multi-variable calculus, linear algebra, C++, knowledge to navigate a large codebase\n\nNo matter which study path you choose, rest assured that there will be plenty of learning materials and your course staff and classmates will be very willing to help!",

Basicaly all DFS  test cases returns correct answer for nodes_expanded, but only the simple one [1,2,5,3,4,0,6,7,8] returns the path.

Does this mean we have to define our own stack and queue classes? Or can we directly use list as stack and collections.deque for queue?\n\n2. Can we use a single set to represent explored_union_frontier nodes or should we make two different data structures as told in the algorithm and check membership separately? \n\n3. Should we do exactly as in the algorithm or can we make changes as long as they do not affect the final outputs and we follow the remove, check and expand order?\n\n4. Probably this question is a little out of the context but, is defining depth and  cost as attributes of a state a good idea in terms of re-usability?\n\nThank you.",

Despite this, I have found to achieve top marks (which is my target for a Masters course), weeks 1-2 took 15hrs each, week 3, 30 hrs and week 4, nearing 40-50 hrs and not finished.  \n\nWeek 4 is excessive as the heuristics that are required to get a basic pass [512, 512, 512, 512, 512] is not as obvious as it seems.  The solution is compounded by the fact the course material specifically states to consider weights including log2 weighting to get a suitable utility for a move. \n\nI am at a point where I have had to  write additional code to run ongoing optimisation of the four  (of five or so) separate heuristics that I have discovered by research and still need further work to write code for the fifth to get the basic grade.  Yes, I will get there in the end, but never in my wildest imagination could I get it done in 8-10 hrs per week.\n\nI have just resigned myself, for this subject, I have to close down all other personal activities (outside a full time job) to get through the material to the standard I have set myself.  It will make me re-consider the rest of the micro-master as an introduction to a Masters degree at the end of this subject.\n\nGood luck.",

Despite this, I have found to achieve top marks (which is my target for a Masters course), weeks 1-2 took 15hrs each, week 3, 30 hrs and week 4, nearing 40-50 hrs and not finished.  </paragraph><paragraph>Week 4 is excessive as the heuristics that are required to get a basic pass [512, 512, 512, 512, 512] is not as obvious as it seems.  The solution is compounded by the fact the course material specifically states to consider weights including log2 weighting to get a suitable utility for a move. </paragraph><paragraph>I am at a point where I have had to  write additional code to run ongoing optimisation of the four  (of five or so) separate heuristics that I have discovered by research and still need further work to write code for the fifth to get the basic grade.  Yes, I will get there in the end, but never in my wildest imagination could I get it done in 8-10 hrs per week.</paragraph><paragraph>I have just resigned myself, for this subject, I have to close down all other personal activities (outside a full time job) to get through the material to the standard I have set myself.  It will make me re-consider the rest of the micro-master as an introduction to a Masters degree at the end of this subject.</paragraph><paragraph>Good luck.</paragraph></document>",

If the difference is greater than one there's a problem. The max search depth is defined by the nodes that are added to the frontier.\n\n    Let's imagine a simple tree of depth 2 and branching of 2. The solution is depth 1. The algorithm adds the first 2 nodes to the frontier so it now has explored max_depth of 1, even though it hasn't expanded those nodes yet.

Etc.\n\n\n\nLonger Summary:\n\n\n\nWe discussed and interpreted some of the challenges that we face with AI.  Not just from a building and history perspective but potential future states as well.  The history of AI was initially optimistic, followed a brief period of reduced funding for research, and is now presently exploding.  \n\n\n\nInitially there was a lot of early optimism with the potential for AI but was followed by a brief period of reduced funding.  However, recently with all the technical advances, it seems like the demand for AI is exploding.  As such, much of the readings revolved around how to understand AI and the potential advantages as well as detriments it can pose.  \"Is Artificial Intelligence Permanently Inscrutable? (Aaron M.

If you think about it, you're breaking the admissibility of the algorithm as detailed further on in the lectures (video + notes). h*(n) is supposed to be the true cost.

If you just store a puzzle state object in the explored set, no other object will be similar to it in python. So 2 puzzle state objects might have the same config, but because python compares objects by reference, when comparing objects for equality, it'll check if the 2 objects are stored in the same address in memory, but they aren't stored in the same place because they were generated from different parents and at different times. If you add objects to the explored set, then your code will run for too long and return the wrong result.\n\n\n\nI hope this post helps someone get started.

For most of the project I simply scored every empty tile as my starting heuristic. For maximum (Player's move) I would test each available move and for minimum (Computer's move) I would pick 4 random moves. I used a depth of 3-5 where 1 level includes both min and max evals. This was too slow and not good enough but it got me to 1024 frequently and allowed me to test that I implemented the pruning and minimax correctly.\n\nTo fix the problem with the speed you need to consider two things. Firstly: The opening of the game has the most potential moves with similar scores. This can eat up a lot of the algorithms time in the first few moves of the game. To get better pruning I \"borrowed\" the technique from the 2048 online game linked in the assignment notes. During the minimize, they put a 2 and a 4 in every tile and scored it. The ones with the 'meanest' scores are selected for maximizing and the totals are then minimized and passed upwards. That keeps the minimize search from becoming HUGE!  Second: But how to know when to stop searching? Or to put another way, how deep to look? Think back to assignment 1 and DFS, because minimax is similar to DFS. I don't want to spoil by just saying what the answer is, but it's very simple (at least in thought, code may be different). With that change I was searching 4-5 levels on average but toward the end as the board simplified I was seeing depth searches in the hundreds.\n\nFinally the heuristics needed to be improved to reach the 2048s. I found the 0 counting and adding an implementation of monotonicity to be very important to achieving those results. I found studying the heuristics from the 2048 online game to be extremely helpful.\n\nIf you've played the game yourself, you may have found that keeping the higher scores against the side or corner of the board is very effective. If you implement monotonicity correctly, the AI will exhibit this behavior as well.\n\nUntil I was ready to submit I used a lot of debug code. I would print the scores from the heuristic functions and the depth and time the player was taking on every move. I would also modify the board passed into the player so that I could examine specific sequences and the players reaction. I found a bug that taught me how to make python 2 dim arrays correctly. You can use the if __name__ == '__main__' in the player to execute tests on that module and therefor look for bugs.\n\nI hope these hints help. Cheers,\n\n     -Stu",

To add to them, I will try to respond to your questions point by point:\n\n1) Handling time limit vs. efficiency: as in most projects, there are many ways to handle this problem. I would keep in mind that as the tree is expanded, the number of nodes to be explored grows exponentially (which goes with what Sfullmer mentioned). Knowing this, you can set a while loop in the beginning of the algorithm to increase the max depth as long the minimax search returns a node within a certain time limit (you’d have to play with it to find a good one, as there is no right/wrong. Just bear in mind that even if you repeat the call within the while loop to get a sense of how deep you can go, shallow depths are calculated very quickly and repeating the call in shallow depths isn’t as time consuming). You can also check the time constraints within the mini/max functions and return an empty node in case the time is almost running out. Again, there is no right or wrong, but play with how far you can stretch your program to make the most of the 0.2 seconds per move you have.\n\n2. Heuristics: from my experience, I could not get 2048 with just 2 heuristics and I think it would be very difficult to do so. As Sfullmer mentioned, monotonicity is a good one (to understand why, just playing the game would help!). Empty tiles and max tile are other ones that can be helpful. There are also others such as smoothness.\n\n3. Tuning weights: finding a good weight balance can be very time consuming, but the right weights will get you to a better score. I’d say don’t be conservative when tuning the weights, assign large numbers just for the purposes of experimentation (how large it will depend on implementation). For certain functions (if not for all of them), use log2 to smooth them out and keep proportions among weights (for instance, if max_tile is 2048, the function shouldn’t return 2048, as this would obviously blow up the proportions). Also think that in special cases you might want to assign a higher or lower weight: for instance, a full board is extremely bad while a 2048 tile is extremely good (knowing these cases will come with watching your program unfold and playing the game yourself).\n\nHope this helps. The 2048 project can feel very daunting at times, but with the right parameters you’ll get to 2048––and it will be so satisfying when you do so! Finally, if you want the staff to take a look on your code, we need you to submit the project through Vocareum so we can see your code. Although we can’t guarantee we will find a bug, we will definitely try to help =)",

If we count 0 the heuristic cost becomes 1+1=2, however, the actual cost is 1(as 1 move is enough to lead to required position (0, 1)). Since the function exceeds actual cost, it would not be admissible and, the A* search would not be optimal. </paragraph></document>",

How do I work around this?\n\nFor example Entropy( 2, 2 ) = - 2/4 log2( 2/4 ) - 2/4 log2( 2/4 ) = 1\n\nBut if I try to determine gain I get:\n\nGain = Entropy( 2, 2 ) - 1/4 * Entropy( 1, 0 ) .... for the other 3 'classes'.\n\nThe problem is that the log (any base) of 0 is -infinity. Would the gain for this example be 1? 0? My hunch is that it would be one because if I take the limit of Entropy ( 1, 0 ) by doing  Entropy ( 0.9, 0.1 ) and Entropy ( 0.99, 0.01 ) the value goes toward 0.

    "text": "Greetings Staff and fellow learners,\n\nI'm having trouble matching betas for the alpha < 1. My learning rate and number of iterations are correct.\n\nOn visual inspection, I find that my linear regression model fits the data well with a plane when alpha = 0.5. See attached image.

Any help would be trully appreciated!</paragraph><paragraph>Julian</paragraph></document>",

Actually you are on a great process if you can finish the rest of the projects and quizzes, and attend the final exam.</paragraph><paragraph>Yes. All the assignments and quizzes will be due on Dec. 8th 2019. The final exam will be released on Dec. 9th, 2019. The course will be end on Dec. 16th, 2019.</paragraph><paragraph>If you cannot finish the course on time, you need to enroll (pay)in the verified track again when we provide the course in the spring. </paragraph><paragraph>Your study materials will keep in your course even if it ends. You can review and go back to see any time you need.  However, you cannot launch the projects, quizzes, and final exam when the course ends. If you will retake the course, the previous record of your submissions of all the assignments and quizzes will be gone, which means that's a new course for you.</paragraph><paragraph>Best,</paragraph><paragraph>Susan</paragraph><paragraph/></document>",

Between Dec. 16th, 2019 and February, will there be access to the ED Discussion Forum and Vocareum? \n\nIt is unfortunate that repeaters are charged for the full price.

How can one possibly work with such immense data structures when I use a complete training set?)\n\nThe facts are, my code is making Vocareum fail over memory problems, and I don't know how I should solve this.\n\nI am pretty confident I am not using/splitting the training data set as I should, but I'm completely lost even after having successfully completed assignment 4, k-folding, cross-validating and all.\n\nOnce again, I need some good advice here as to how I should pre-process or split data sets in order to achieve the given model training without making Vocareum blow up.\n\nThanks to anybody who'd be glad to help.\n\nJulian",

There are a variety of ways to do this which you can google. I did this on each row as I read it from the original files. Why did I replace with a space instead of removing altogether? The hint to do that was located in the stopwords file. You will see there are some single characters, like \"I\" and \"m\", but not \"Im\". This indicates the word \"I'm\" is supposed to be split into \"I m\" and then cleaned up. \n\nHINT: You can add to the stopwords yourself. Look at the input data. Is there anything that appears often that isn't a word? \n\nAfter removing the punctuation and creating the CSV file and reloading it, I used CountVectorizer to vectorize the data. I do this twice, once for unigram and once for bigram. You will notice in the documentation that CountVectorizer can accept a list of stopwords that it will remove for you.

I did this by using the list of punctuation in \"string.punctuation\". There are a variety of ways to do this which you can google. I did this on each row as I read it from the original files. Why did I replace with a space instead of removing altogether? The hint to do that was located in the stopwords file. You will see there are some single characters, like \"I\" and \"m\", but not \"Im\". This indicates the word \"I'm\" is supposed to be split into \"I m\" and then cleaned up. </paragraph><paragraph>HINT: You can add to the stopwords yourself. Look at the input data. Is there anything that appears often that isn't a word? </paragraph><paragraph>After removing the punctuation and creating the CSV file and reloading it, I used CountVectorizer to vectorize the data. I do this twice, once for unigram and once for bigram. You will notice in the documentation that CountVectorizer can accept a list of stopwords that it will remove for you. Also notice it accepts a parameter that makes it into a unigram or bigram vectorizer. </paragraph><paragraph>Hope this helps!</paragraph><paragraph> </paragraph></document>",

However, this did not provide the correct answer all the time. My current method is to provide an addition check if the node has any neighbors at all, and if it does not, then it won't increment (i.e. only increment counter if neighbors is not empty, regardless of whether any of it's elements are added to the frontier or in the explored set). Using this method, I get the right answer most of the time, except for one DFS and one A* test case by the grader.\n\nAs such, I was asking my original questions above so that I could clarify whether my assumptions (in by method explained above) are correct and whether one of these assumptions is the reason I am getting the wrong results.\n\nThanks,\n\nMichael",

My internet has been glitchy at my house for the past week and I have no alternative place to take this exam, given the physical restrictions imposed by the Proctored rules. \n\nThe PSI software should really accommodate few seconds of internet outage...\n\nOn my first try I scored 30%, being able to answer around 10 questions. On this second try, scored 55% while being able to answer about half the questions before the internet glitch. I am afraid of asking for the test reset again and get an early glitch which would prevent me from answering almost no questions. So I am giving up on the Final Exam out of fear of getting another internet glitch.\n\nI know I was going to do really well in this exam and really prepared for this. Having this low grade in the Final Exam because the PSI software is that strict really puts a stain in this excellent course experience I was having so far. My current Total Grade is now 84% but I know I could do much better if not for the PSI software combined with my bad internet this week.\n\nWhy can't PSI continue the recording offline while internet is not restored? That would keep the entire record of the exam. This really seems like an easy fix.\n\nPlease let me know if there is any alternative, or at least a way to hold my current grade in case there is another glitch if I can try again. I am not keeping my hopes up though, I understand there are predetermined rules in place.\n\n Thank you for your support.",

I am afraid of asking for the test reset again and get an early glitch which would prevent me from answering almost no questions. So I am giving up on the Final Exam out of fear of getting another internet glitch.</paragraph><paragraph>I know I was going to do really well in this exam and really prepared for this. Having this low grade in the Final Exam because the PSI software is that strict really puts a stain in this excellent course experience I was having so far. My current Total Grade is now 84% but I know I could do much better if not for the PSI software combined with my bad internet this week.</paragraph><paragraph>Why can't PSI continue the recording offline while internet is not restored? That would keep the entire record of the exam. This really seems like an easy fix.</paragraph><paragraph>Please let me know if there is any alternative, or at least a way to hold my current grade in case there is another glitch if I can try again. I am not keeping my hopes up though, I understand there are predetermined rules in place.</paragraph><paragraph> Thank you for your support.</paragraph></document>",

    "text": "Let me share my experience on the PSI Secure Browser.  As many had encountered, I also got the \"bandwidth\" issue which reason was identified by the Secure Software support.  My resolution was 1) to use more powerful CPU, 2) to use lower resolution display,  and 3) to avoid using a PDF reader.\n\nWhen I took the practice exam with Dell XPS 13 (screen resolution: 3200x1800), the practice was so smooth, and I did not get any issues.  At that time I did not use any other software (as PSI Secure Browser request the confirmation to kill such software), did not browse any other material including Columbia University webpages.  I thought I have no issue with that testing environment.\n\nI took the final exam on Tuesday in the original final week.  I used the same PC in the same wired network environment (which I later measured upstream at 300Mbps, downstream at 700Mbps).  This time I tried to use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to view my notes and the handouts in digital form.  At the 2nd question I wanted to confirm the answer on the handout, and started to flip pages.  Then I was kicked out of the exam.  I contacted the Secure Software and got to know that the reason of disconnection was insufficient bandwidth, which seems a little weird.\n\nI thought it might be the nature of the PSI Secure Browser, because such software should be used also at real test center typically carrying out closed-book tests.  If so, it needs to detect cheating through running other software.  Although the use PDF reader is allowed in our case, running some other software might be affecting in a bad way.  The browser also reminded me at the booting time that it uploads the image from webcam, and all the activity on the screen is recorded.  So it would make sense to think that the use of PDF reader became a big load for the laptop's CPU to compress such higher resolution screen to upload, and it would be possible that such load resulted and/or was detected as insufficient bandwidth.\n\nBased on that assumption, when I retook the exam, I prepared a box PC with a powerful CPU and more memory.  I connected a full-HD (1920x1080) display instead of one with higher resolution.  I also prepared my notes and the handouts in physical form to avoid the use of the PDF reader.  It was a very good experience to take the proctored exam which went so smooth until the end of the exam.  I really enjoyed the final exam.",

Also make sure you use stratified sampling (i.e. same ratio of positive to negative in both the training and testing datasets).
