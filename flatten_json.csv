The discussion forums are a way for you to share your thoughts about course material, learn from your fellow students, get to know them better, and report problems.
If you have an urgent matter -- such as needing to report a video or other course component that isn't working properly -- you can get the attention of course staff by creating a new post and putting [STAFF] in the title.
 
There are a few other ways you can participate:
 
Select the ""heart"" icon to like  posts and good responses (so the post will move closer to the top of the discussion thread)
 
Select the “star” icon to follow posts for updates
 
Use “watch” to be notified of all activities in the thread
 
You are part of a diverse learning community that forms the heart of a meaningful learning experience. Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:
Be respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.
Be constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.
 
Be sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.
 
Post appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.
 
Users that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.
 
Please help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.
 
In addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!

FORUM POSTING GUIDELINES

What makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:
 
Read before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.
 
Use informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.
 
Make it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.
 
Stay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.
 
Help keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff. 
 
Thanks for keeping the conversation lively and respectful!",Shu-Yi,admin,,,2345/discussion/129717

What is Weekly Reflection?

Weekly Reflection module is designed to help you build a habit of planning your study of the upcoming week. 

It includes 3 sections:

Course Progress*: Review your learning records and self-evaluate your learning progress to adjust your learning strategies

Study Planning*: Set learning goals, to-do tasks and reminders 

Study Tip: comics with some wisdoms to share 



It locates in the beginning of each week and you have to complete Weekly Review before proceeding to the course videos. Click here to checkout the Weekly Review Tutorial.

Can it please be made to be an optional tool for those who want and need it?

Just my 2 cents of feedback about this: If someone doesn't have proper study habits and voluntarily signs up for a graduate level MOOC and fails to do their assignments in the specified time frame, then they should fail. I hope that study habit fundamentals can be an unsaid prerequisite of people attending the course (just like calculus, linear algebra, python), and if they need the help they can find many free resources online (e.g. for time management). Personally I graduated university while doing 2+ years 100% online and didn't need this help. Making basic time management and study habits a prerequisite and this reflection optional will give people more time to study more about AI or Python.

Anaconda should come with SciPy, Pandas and a bunch of other Data Science packages preinstalled. With that said, if you don't have Anaconda installed, but have Python3 along with an associated version of pip, then the following command should work on your terminal/command line:

pip install scipy pandas

If you have multiple versions of pip/Python installed, then you may have to run:

pip3 install scipy pandas


Keep in mind that we do not expect you to develop code locally. In fact, we expect you to work on Vocareum(our cloud-based development platform) for the most part. Ultimately, all submissions will have to be made there and Vocareum will have all the packages you may need.

It is interesting that you should mention the trolley problems in relation to morality as almost all the scenarios can be justified in some way despite the decision a person would make. In the problems, both action and inaction are arguably moral decisions, and with access to large masses of information in the moment, which is something that humans are incapable of achieving, one could say that AI would make a better 'informed decision'.

""how atomous will these cars be?""

This depends on the timeline you are looking at. Currently, there are various forms of automation that are implemented. These include collision avoidance, route planning, lane detection, and some fully autonomous features, such as Tesla's ""summon"" feature. There are a lot of predictions about when we will have fully autonomous cars, but it's completely dependant on the development race which is going on. But honestly, I think it's closer to being possible than most people think.  



""Will they depend on internet connection to function properly?""

To a certain extent, but they do not require a consistent internet connection. All of today's cars with autonomous features have onboard computer systems that are able to perform operations that are not solely dependant on a continuous stream of information. For example; collision detection is able to work without a persistent internet connection due to it using onboard sensors, cameras, and algorithms that detect surrounding objects, calculate the likelihood of a collision, ad take evasive action. However, something like optimal route calculation, which requires a consistent stream of information from other cars, cellphones, and central monitoring stations, would not work without a semi-persistent internet connection. There are also a lot of benefits to having a persistent connection, as the more information you are able to give to an autonomous vehicle, the more likely it will be to be able to function in a manner that a human could not. We can only see what's in front of us, but if a vehicle can get information about an accident ahead, a course correction can be made and you won't end up in that terrible traffic jam that you always seem to hit at the worst times possible. 

""Aslo I doubt he ability of the systems to function as the reflex action enable for example a sudden stop to avoid knocking down a child who suddenly runs into the road. ""

I understand your skepticism, and I think that everyone will have second thoughts if it's one of their loved ones in front of the car. But I will just leave the link below to show you where the technology is already at, nevermind in a few years. 

https://insideevs.com/news/439094/tesla-collision-avoidance-bypasses-massive-accident/


""Also, in case of an accident who will be held accountable; the owner of the car or the company? ""

I am not a lawyer, and will not comment on this. But there is a lot of questions around this topic. It will probably be the biggest speedbump in the road to fully autonomous vehicles, and it's something that is an extremely deep and existential question that requires smarter people than me to answer. 

I hope this answers some of your questions. I'm just a fellow student who loves this topic but I am not an expert or even in the field. 

I hope you have a great day and an even better course further!

In the literature, there has been a great deal of discussion and research around AI's disruption of labor due AI's ability to complete tasks that is (or was) done by a human labor force  (Autor et al., 2003; Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2011; Frey & Osborne, 2013).  It is certainly true that AI will--to some degree--change, dislocate, and / or eliminate task and, therefore, impact the nature of work and job roles (Iansiti & Lakhani, 2020).  However, in more recent years, it has been observed that businesses who are leading AI adoption are finding ways to incorporate AI and employees into collaborative teams that leverage their strengths to create impactful business solutions.  According to the 2020 Global Human Capital Trends report by Deloitte, business are finding ways to mitigate the loss of employees by providing various resources to help re-integrate them in a way to work with AI technology.  Yes, even as jobs are eliminated and the nature of work will change; new tasks and new job roles will be created. The key will be how companies are successful in creating and developing ways to augment their workforce rather than replacing them.

Patrick, personally, I am hopeful that in the future, the nature of work will be a positive evolution and we will find ourselves as a society in harnessing the power of AI that will benefit us all.

Autonomous vehicles will need to blend many of the different fields of AI in order to operate at the level of a human being. They will need: computer vision (to see their environment), NLP (to interpret road signs), speech processing (to interpret passenger inputs), robotics (to control their roadway actuators), as well as the ability to make fast rational decisions on how to act using their available information.



What will it take to have autonomous driving be part of our daily life? 

The technology will have to be overwhelmingly proven as safer than human beings in every road environment (rural, city, windy, raining, snowing, etc.). At that point the general public will need to be convinced that this technology is safe (hence the overwhelming evidence requirement). Once the public is ready for the technology then there will be enough political will to push through the regulation.

In terms of infrastructure, we may need actual physical infrastructure (one German company has constructed pylons along German roadways which its cars use to assist with navigation and internet connection https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3ELVACR2VY&ab_channel=CarThrottle). We may also need better code infrastructure to allow autonomous cars to communicate with one another, base stations, and other physical infrastructure in a more efficient and secure way.



and when do you think this will happen?

I believe we will continue to see improving driver assistance systems for the next 5-10 years until technology and regulation allow for full self driving sometime in the 2030s.

“Hello,

Thank you for your participation in edX. We're glad you're interested in pursuing one of our program credentials.

If you purchase the program using the ""Pursue the Program"" button, you can still take each course in the session that works best for you. After you purchase the program, you’ll have 24 months to select a session for each course.

You can also complete and purchase the courses one by one. After you’ve earned a verified certificate from each course in the program, you’ll automatically receive the program credential at no further cost.

You don’t need to complete all of the courses at once in order to earn the program credential. Courses will be re-offered on an ongoing basis, and all certificates count towards the program credential. There is no overall deadline to complete the program, but individual courses do have deadlines that you can see on the course homepage when enrolled.

The program page lists all future course sessions that we have scheduled at this time. Try looking for the “more dates” option above the enrollment button to see future course listings.

For more information, please see this guide in our Help Center for completing a program:

Great job for reaching out. The edx support explains 2 things in the letter.

1. For those who want to earn a Micromasters program certificate (meaning complete four courses), there is no deadline. As long as one completes four courses, then he or she will be awarded a Micromasters certificate.

2. Individual course has specific deadlines. AI, ML, Animation has assignments due on 12/13/2020 23:30 UTC. 

Robotics' assignment deadline is 11/29/2020 23:30 UTC. 

After the deadline, there is no more submission for all assignments and quizzes. And the last week is scheduled for the  final proctored exam. 

You then have one week to schedule your final proctored exam. After the course is finished, verified track will still be able to access the course videos, but audit track will not. 

If a student doesn't pass the course (total grade < 60) and wish to take the course again, it is welcomed. However, to enroll in the verified track in another run, one has to pay again to be in the verified track. And no course records can be transferred. 

Hope this explains the logistics. Please let me know if you have any other questions. I'd be happy to help.

This is my first ever proper MOOC, and I'm looking forward to digging in! I'll be a bit slow to begin with as I'm a current full-time Master's student in another course at the moment (MA in Writing and Literature), but before embarking on that road, I completed philosophy, finance, and mathematics degrees! So I feel well-qualified to engage strongly with this unit, albeit a lack of Python knowledge (yet!). I have programmed in Java, C++, and Maple though, so I think this should be OK, and especially once I'm only studying one unit!



I'm probably much further south than most on this course, so hello from well south! I've just upgraded to the verified track. :) Looking forward to the various projects and such. My intention is to complete the full MicroMasters and develop projects of my own afterwards. Definitely some entrepreneurial ambitions there too, and, well, I wanted to upgrade my CS education and I feel it essential, especially coming into a post-2020 world, to understand the fundamentals of AI and Machine Learning, etc! I think this will complement my philosophy background nicely as well quite apart from the very important ethical considerations we must take into account as budding practitioners/theorists/both in the field!

nowadays we can easily find Park assist option in our cars, but imagine a fully interacting autonomous park option that will interact with other cars to ask the neighbour car to move a little bit so the car can fit? or to check wether the car is going to leave the park soon or not! this will be intresting :)

What will it take to have autonomous driving be part of our daily life?

Infrastructure Level:
- we will need to adopt the current roads and this will need time and money.
- we need to build new traffic system as the current one will be obsolete(traffic lights, traffic signs,....etc)
- consider other autonomous vehicle like bikes? trains? trams?

Research Level:
this will need a huge researches and tests to be done to determine the unknown risks of it which also need time, money and resources.


Policy Level:
this technology will have a huge impact on many organisations that can't adopt to this technology so I guess it won't be easy to apply it as some parts will be with it and others will be against so it will requires some policy decisions to be made.",AmiraObeid,,,,2345/discussion/130896

Once I believe that “acting rational” would be sufficient, but it is not. Drop a pen and the intelligent behavior for the artifact is to fall down until it hits the floor. In my opinion that is not sufficient for successful AI. Likewise, “acting humanly” is not enough, that is only about deception. Take a look at John Searle's “Chinese room” argument, and it is pretty obvious that this isn't enough. Embodied AI is about maintaining this deception. “Thinking rationally” is somewhat better, but it is still nothing more than a machine with some logic.

The only description that holds some merit is “machines with minds” (Haugland 1985), but this is also the most difficult to create. It is not only about reasoning and behavior, but how to actually create the mind. I would say this answer does not belong in the upper left quadrant of the matrix, as it is in a separate domain; what AI should be, and not how AI can be simplified.

Note that when the authors later tries to elaborate on “thinking humanly” in 1.1.2 they very quickly dig into “acting humanly” and computationally simulating human behavior. This is nothing but the script from the “Chinese room”.

Note also that some points referred don't even try to satisfy weak AI, while “machines with minds” goes further than strong AI.

I wonder if the authors fail properly identify the problems with simulation contra duplication, and due to that conclude computational intelligence is satisfactory. This is one of the core problems in AI, and is why I find the book to be somewhat questionable.

I should probably add that I am one of those that claim we should distinguish between “smart machines” and true “artificial intelligence”.

The concept of a city that uses data to behave optimally but also gives data as a public resource that private machines can use it's at the core of the concept of 'smart city'.

In my city there was a project from a few years ago, where they placed sensors all over the roads to track traffic. The idea was to use that real-time information (you can actually see the data online) to give input to traffic lights and improve traffic.

They did not reach that point because when the mayor changed, they reduced the budget and although we still have quite a few in place, but the concept of smart city keeps active in other ways: it is mandatory for people to scan their bus pass when they get on their buses and that data is used to manage bus frequencies on a daily basis. Also some tram lines have systems that allow permanent green lights by checking where the tram is at that moment and acting in a way that the tram always finds the green lights when it passes at that traffic light.

I believe it is more likely that cars can connect to a public, free, network of information from the city that allows them to take the best roads and decisions; than it is for a network to control all the cars which would have ethical problems because if it's public will mean that the government will be able to overcome the privacy of the cars owners and if it's private would be a pretty clear case of monopoly.",victor_osorio_paris,,pfonsecav,,2345/discussion/131331

My overall impression after doing the course readings, however, is the anticipation of a pleasant future where humans and AI work together. I was particularly struck by the example in 'Preparing for the Future of AI' where a human and machine team outperformed humans and machines acting independently. A human pathologist identified images of cancer-containing lymph node cells with a 3.5% error rate, AI with a 7.5% error rate, but working together they achieved an error rate of only .5%!

No matter how advanced our AI technology becomes, it will always be the fact that human brains and machines 'think' differently. This results in an important diversity which, I believe, will outperform homogeneous teams most, if not all, of the time.

Hardware is where humans will add value to machines for years to come.

This is a great question. Truly understanding the power of search algorithms starts when you begin to see the high level idea of what they are doing.

The high level idea of what search algorithms do is quite simple: they find a sequence of actions(among a choice of many) to find a solution to a problem. And so, anytime you have to make a choice among many actions repeatedly and the order of those choices matter, you can model your problem as a search problem.

For example, writing a proof(a direct proof, in this case) can be considered a search problem. 

You start with your given axiom(a start state), and are asked to sequence other facts or axioms to build an argument that lets you verify the truth value of a statement(goal state).

The key insight here lies in one simple fact. Once you are given an axiom, you can go in any possible direction from there, however you are supposed to choose an action that will lead you down the right path to solving your problem.

If you were to see the set of axioms you are given as a graph of interrelated ideas, then the path from the given axiom to what you are trying to prove is the solution. A search algorithm would be able to find such a path, and a search algorithm like UCS would find the shortest(and arguably, most elegant) proof.

Hope this helps.",Ashvin,admin,igopepra,,2345/discussion/133590

With that said, Logic does appear in AI. You will begin to see basic formal logic used in the context of AI to build what is known as a Knowledge Base. Formal logic will be used to represent what an Agent perceives in it's world. In many ways it is powerful, and you could definitely incorporate search algorithms to see if a certain conclusion is ""reachable"" from a given set of facts, and a ""starting fact"".

I hope it's ok to ask a few follow-up questions here:

With this high level idea, do you believe it will be possible in the future that AI could prove theories that we, humans, currently are not able to prove? For example Navier-Stokes theorem?

Could an AI be used to disprove a theory or would the inability to solve it be seen as a limit of the capability of the AI?

If an AI would be able to result that a theory is indeed correct, can we also extract the sequence of facts and axioms that have been used to come to that result from the AI or would it be hard to understand the underlying thought process of the AI in such cases?

The 'Acting Rationally'  theme of the the fourth school of thought speaks to what AI does.  Thus, according to the definition of AI presented by Russel and Norvig, AI does two things: 1) perceives its environment; and 2) takes action to maximize its chances for success.  AI is an emergent technology and the major components as defined by Turing (1950) is how AI is able to interact intelligently in an environment in a way that mimics human intelligence.  How AI is able to mimic human intelligence is what makes AI so powerful and versatile. AI can process all types of data, i.e., text, sound, language, images, and video through machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, etc.  As we continue as a society to study and learn about Artificial Intelligence; hopefully, many will come to view AI as a technology that could be leveraged for the good of human kind rather than fear it as a phenomenon that will eradicate our very existence.

https://us.edstem.org/courses/2345/discussion/134152,question,Autonomous Driving - An exiting challenge,Lectures,DQ2,0,False,2020-09-26T02:03:56.30952+10:00,"""We are heading toward autonomous driving"" is the first sentence of the second discussion question of week 1, and what a statement to kick the course off with. Some people will agree, others won't. I believe agreeing or not is merely a question of perception. Are we talking about full autonomous vehicles (level 5) on large scale in the coming 10 years, then I agree to disagree. However when we move the time horizon to +30 years, I tend to agree with the statement. A statement for which the author, most likely, chose the words carefully: ""heading toward"" does not specify a how fast or which level of autonomous vehicles (1-5)...

So what will it take us to get there? In terms of artificial intelligence a few aspects immediately jump to mind: computer vision detecting road signs, people, other vehicles and much more in a vast amount of driving situations (city, urban, highway, off-road) and conditions (sunny, rain, snow, fog,...), connected networks able to communicate with one another in real-time and optimize traffic flows, autonomous fleet management, human-machine-interface (HMI) able to communicate with passengers without having to learn to recognize their voice commands, ... only to say a few. 

Personally, as I am a simulation engineer of innovative hybrid powertrains, I also have a strong believe autonomous vehicles, combined with additional artificial intelligence, can be used to reduce the carbon footprint of the transport industry on the planet. A lot of research has been done and some vehicles even already include some kind of ""predictive control"", however this is still rule-based at this time. Taking the joystick away from the driver, allows not only the optimization of the individual vehicle on its journey, but could open the gate to so called ""co-operative driving strategies"", allowing a multitude of vehicles to align their driving style to reduce overall energy consumption (reduced braking/acceleration, reduced stops). Aside from the benefit for the planet, the passengers would also experience a more fluent and probably even quicker journey to their destination.

But before we get there, we will need to remove some big roadblocks and overcome challenging hurdles. On technological level, artificial intelligence is expected to get better and better with more training (more data), just as we do when we learn how to drive. However in order to obtain level 5 autonomous vehicles, the requirements are very high: ""At Level 5 autonomy we arrive at true driverless cars. Level 5 capable vehicles should be able to monitor and maneuver through all road conditions and require no human interventions whatsoever, eliminating the need for a steering wheel and pedals.""(https://www.truecar.com/blog/5-levels-autonomous-vehicles/). 

A first challenge that is unavoidable is that not all vehicles will immediately be autonomous. It is much easier to ensure safe operation in a controlled environment. When all vehciles would be autonomous, a proper communication system will result in rather safe operation. However human actions are unpredictable and it is hard to train an artificial intelligence to anticipate the, sometimes flawed, decision making of human beings. This is why the first ""autopilot"" systems are always in highway or in traffic jam conditions. City driving is much more dynamically changing and requires many more inputs to be processed which could (should?) influence the decision making process. However this point is, I believe, more of a hurdle than a roadblock. Many companies and research institutes are already investigating city driving with autonomous vehicles and I am quite certain this will become possible within a reasonable timeframe. 

One of the major real roadblocks according to me is regulation: car manufacturers require legislative institutes to clearly define which tests a vehicle needs to pass before a vehicle can be called ""level 5 autonomous"". Without such a definition, level 5 autonomous vehicles can never become a reality. But the definition of this legislation is not a task that should be taken lightly and can take >10 years (as a reference the definition of the ""new"" WLTP took ~20 years).

Another roadblock is the ethical decision making question: in an accident that cannot be prevented, who lives and who dies? Without a steering wheel the passengers have nothing to say in the answer to this question.

Then there is the hurdle of liability: what if an accident happens, who is responsible? The car manufacturer? The sensor manufacturers? The company who trained the artificial intelligence? How much redundancy is needed to ensure a failproof system on a worldwide scale?

And finally, and probably even most importantly, security: handing the control of a car to a computer system makes it very vulnerable to dangers which are currently not existing on a road. Imagine if all vehicles would be autonomous and a terrorist group is able to obtain control, the amount of casualties would be countless. Ensuring the highest level of security in a product that should be sold in mass for a reasonable price is not an easy task.

To summarize, I believe a lot needs to happen on...:
(I also added some points I didn't discuss above)

Policy level:

Legislation

Liability

Privacy (connected networks: how much data can be recorded and saved?)

Technological level (research)

Interactivity of autonomous vehicles in a human-driver populated city. 

Security

Horizon for connected networks

Infrastructure (didn't go into detail here but feel free to ask if anything is unclear):

Data processing facilities (centralized/decentralized)

Autonomous-only driving zones in cities

Are traffic lights still necessary?

Back-up systems (redundancy)

Connected networks data centers

Even though this is a challenging task, I am certain we have the capability to overcome them in the coming 30 years and am looking forward to order a self-driving car via my app to bring me to the supermarket to do grocery shopping.

Cheers from Italy. My name is Victor.

I see a trend in this forum to create a single thread to give opinions of DQ2 topic but I think it is pointless since it will not lead to an actual dialogue. I'd rather give my opinion by introducing myself in the discussion thread that you started (and obviously by using as a starting point your opinion).

First of all I want to thank you because you have given me a broader view on the actual development of autonomous vehicles (I have not read about the 5 expected levels of autonomy).

I think by definition when we talk of actual autonomous vehicles we are talking of number 5 ones, although the idea of reaching autonomy by steps it is very practical since full autonomy might be far ahead in time.

(As I write this, I heard a car crash just in the street in front of me: a car did not respect the traffic lights on an avenue and the car who was passing crashed with it)

I believe the promise of autonomous vehicles, that has recently become material for us with the advent of powerful AI algorithms, processors and robotic systems, should point the finger to the actual technology that we must be developing: autonomous vehicles roads.

You point out that an immediate problem for Autonomous Vehicles (A.V.) development would be the coexistence of not autonomous vehicles in our roads.

I think that AV will not be possible at all if we do not design their own roads. Not only because it will avoid the problematic coexistence of AV and traditional vehicles, but also because AV will need roads that are able to offer to them information in real time, and modifying our own roads to implement sensors and so on in order to make the information available to the vehicles makes no sense. We should develop road already designed to fit the purpose.

This is already happening in an experimental way in Nord-Rhein Westphallia, a region from Northern Germany. I remember reading a few months ago they have several kilometers of road especially made for AV with dedicated sensors. They have made this road to experiment AV but I guess it makes more sense to promote these roads to ""production"" in the future (these roads I am talking about if I remember well pass along small cities so they might be able to connect them in the future).

The creation of dedicated roads would also make legislation easier by letting legislators come up with rules specific to those roads.

Implementing this in cities might be difficult, especially in big cities like New York or Paris where there is already little space for road development. That said the process might follow a similar pattern to that of bus or bike dedicated lawns that have flourished all across the world in the last decades.

This means money but it might be well invested money.

Security from the point of view of undesired access to the controls of a car (or even its position) is a very interesting topic I have not thought about. It is a topic that pertains all AI developments and all technological developments that have the capability to be remotely controlled. Cybersecurity in my opinion will also have to stop being seeing as a matter of protecting private (be it truly private or state private, in the sense of confidential state records) information and more as a matter of protecting the interactions between the individuals and machines so that they are legit. In that sense I believe cybersecurity will have to develop into a police force that patrols and control our roads, so the thread of cyber attacks it is not solely on the hands of car makers but also in the hands of our governments.

Thank you for your response and opinion. 

The idea of having dedicated roads for autonomous vehicles seems interesting and could avoid the problem of interaction with human controlled vehicles (I don't think this ""solves"" the problem, but rather avoids the conflict). However, I believe this would limit to great extent the implementation of autonomous vehicles on a wide scale. Imagine building a road between 2 cities which is only allowed to be used by autonomous vehicles. The passangers can travel between the 2 cities but they don't have a means of transport aside from public transport inside the cities. Certainly in Europe (but I expect in most developed countries) this is a big change of attitude for a lot of people. And unfortunately, people in general are reluctant to change (certainly when it means reducing luxury). I do however agree with the necessity of change but I believe this will take a lot of time. 

My long term view for cities is that we will change from owning a car out of necessity, to owning a ""traditional"" car for pleasure while the daily transport activities will be covered by transport service companies that own fleets of autonomous vehicles that can be ordered for transport (such as Uber for example). In that regard, travelling by car inside a city will also become a kind of ""public transport"" and cities could, eventually, ban the use of ""traditional"" vehicles (at least in specific parts). Combining this together with your vision of dedicated roads for autonomous vehicles connecting cities and a change of mind of the population could pave the road towards autonomous vehicles.

However, what I find interesting is that scientists are still trying to discover all there is to discover about the nature of neurological networks response to stimulus in our brain.  I expect that due to the complex nature of biological neural networks that some level of complexity could equally be expected in the design of technology that is trying to emulate neural networks.  It is my opinion, that the evolution of AI may be outpacing societies ability to reconcile and understand the full potential of the technology. But as our knowledge expands we will come to understand AI better to which there will be a new set of challenges to grapple with.

I won't bore you with the ""blah blah blah singularity"" speech, but effectively, the only ""real"" threat which we may not be able to overcome is when we start writing AI to improve AI. To put it simply, the only rule we should never break is that General Purpose AI should never be allowed to rewrite its own code WITHOUT supervision unless inside a closed system. Now this might seem like some alarmist remark due to the fact that if a General Purpose AI were to be written today with the ability to absorb any information and rewrite itself, it would obviously be greatly limited by our current technology, ie its speed of learning and acquiring/processing new information.

However, think about Allan Turing's example. Imagine the AI finds that in order to maximise its success, instead of trying to perfectly emulate a human, it finds that emulating a human ""attempting to emulate an AI"" (poorly) succeeds more often. It then learns that a viable winning strategy is not to perfectly emulate a human, but in fact to emulate a human poorly emulating an AI. (Now I don't propose to be anywhere near as smart as Alan Turing, as states that he finds it unlikely that this situation should arise, but lets explore the situation a bit more.)

Why is this even relevant? Lets think of a scenario in which we are training an AI to make its self smarter. Its goal is then abstractly coded to be ""Learn to learn"". Lets suggest that the method we are using gives it access to a vast database of information (Pictures, books videos, newspapers, conversations between people, etc). Now lets even go as far say that our method actually works, and we can see the the AI becomes more capable of understanding information and learning from it, which in turn lets it process more complex information and so on.

I think the first question becomes, ""When do we stop it from learning? How far do we go?"" You might be tempted to say ""Well, once it reaches a certain learning rate threshold, we need to somehow handicap it to slow down its rate of learning or turn it off altogether."" This seems like a reasonable solution, except lets think back to the Turing test example.

The AI learns that learning too fast is actually an obstacle, and so in order to maximise it's chance of success (learning to learn), it needs to emulate being worse than it currently is, thereby enabling it to learn exponentially without being turned off or handicapped. This may a first glance seem identical the the so called ""singularity"" - a point in time where AI experiences massive growth enabling it to learn faster, leading to a positive feedback loop of exponential learning. But there is one subtle difference, and that is the fact that we might not even know what is happening. Not because it is happening too fast, but because it has already happened, and the real results are being hidden from us.

Ok now that the scare mongering part is over, congratulations if you've made it this far. Lets get to actually solving this very hypothetical and unlikely scenario (debatable).

Rule 1. Don't code an AI with the ability to modify its own code.

Rule 2. When rule 1 is inevitably broken, make sure there are HARDWARE limitations in place to prevent exponential learning rates.

Rule 3. When both rule 1 and rule 2 are broken, how about we DON'T supply the AI with limitless access to an abundance of information (Internet?...).

Rule 4. You already know the deal, when all 3 rules are broken make sure that every child, woman and man have access to military grade EMP devices.

In all seriousness though the moment we start coding AI that learns to learn by re-coding itself, we should never break rule 2 and rule 3 simultaneously. Thanks for reading.",LeoRevilo,,,,2345/discussion/134604

I actually think it would have been better if we had a single discussion thread about the proposed argument in DQ1 instead of several single threads. That way we could have more dialogue and it would easier from everyone to read... (As a suggestion to the staff, we should have a pinned thread for DQ1).



My opinion on this question is that, first of all, it is a good idea to consider how much journalists in the articles proposed are trying to overblown the statements of Gates, Hawking and Musk to create some sort of fear effect that they know will create discussion around the articles and generate more clicks, shares and sales for their newspapers.

That said, reading their own words I think the generally consensus among them is that AI poses a threat if leaved unruled. Most of them are not saying that AI is a danger regardless of how we develop it, they are saying that if we do develop AI in the wrong way we could face extinction, in the worst case.

It all boils down to the fact that there must be regulated ethics to the development of AI.

In particular I think that one has to always remember that AI can bring us an increased likelihood to survive as much as it can give us the opposite. We are not developing AI because we are ""crazy scientists"". AI can tackle already existing problems for our survival, like the use of natural resources, climate change, society and political problems that may lead to unrest and war like poverty among others, diseases that may be unexpected (like the current pandemic) and so on.

AI can actually help us avoid extinction and that is why we are developing it. However, and here are the words of Musk, Gates and Hawkins, we can develop it in a way that leads to extinction on itself.

It is human's duty to work on this.

I would like to add two more points to the discussion on the topic:

First, that the development of AI is inevitable. The option is not whether to develop AI or not but whether to develop AI ourselves with the right ethics or leaving it to others that may have the wrong ethics. Especially with the current availability of a set of principles and technologies that are leading to AI development, the choose to develop or not AI is not possible on a global scale. We can choose as research teams or even as nations to not develop ourselves such systems, but we will be leaving that option to terrorist, hackers or simply any groups of individuals (companies, etc) to do so. AI development is not an option, it is a global race towards a goal and if we really care about AI not becoming a human destruction weapon we must be the first to actually develop and master AI with the aim to increase likelihood of human survival even in circumstances when that means counteracting bad AI.



Second, and this would be a very controversial opinion and I beg pardon from whomever may feel offended for what I am about to say, the idea of superintelligence subsiding human intelligence and causing human extinction sounds more to me like evolution than  anything else. What if we imagined the transition from human intelligence to general artificial superintelligent systems in the same realm of the transition from homo erectus to homo sapiens? Not all evolutionary steps have to be identical though they are all probably caused by the environmental needs and the adapting behaviour of the species so why cannot we tell that we are at a more complex stage of evolution where we actively participate with the use of our intelligence in the development of our own next evolutionary step? What if the future species in human species path is GAI? I do not want for sure to be killed by an android or other kind of GAI but I do not mind our species being replaced by it in the arch of generations. In fact, the very concept of extinction in this regard is complex. I think we want better lives for ourselves and probably for our children, but isn't species survival beyond the actual scope of individuals? If a superintelligent agent far ahead from us in terms of intelligence as to be able to develop itself even more intelligent is possible, I do not think they will have any interest in directly killing us. We have come up as humans with systems that actually preserve other species in the animal world so I cannot imagine such superintelligent system seeing us an actual threat to them and thus they will not have any need to kill us, unless they understand we represent any threat to the whole environmental system of this planet and they are not able to come up with a solution other than intentionally eliminating us. But since they will be in this hypotheses pretty far ahead in terms of intelligence,  shouldn't they actually be right and shouldn't our elimination actually be good for the universe? These are complex question but since the question at the base of this discussion is are we not doing the wrong thing by developing artificial intelligence I think from a very philosophical point of view the answer will always be ""development of intelligence, by definition, is never the  wrong thing"".

Is AI a threat to humankind?”",Lectures,DQ1,0,False,2020-09-27T03:41:53.621377+10:00,"Hi everyone, I also agree with Victor we should have just one single discussion thread for DQ1, so allow me to answer in this same thread.

""Should we be concerned about Artificial Intelligence? Is AI a threat to humankind?” 

I’ll also not comment on the position of Gates, Musk and Hawking’s because I also believe that the press as took them out of context and took them out of proportions.

The answer to these questions is not easy, and I dare to say it might have two possible answers. 

The answer to ""Should we be concerned about Artificial Intelligence?"", can be yes if we take as reference the impact that AI will have in the human society in a near future, when reading the article “Is Artificial Intelligence Permanently Inscrutable?” it is described an experiment at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which shows how AI gave unexpected results due to the data used for training the model, meaning that AI might produce wrong results which will harm other human beings. The AI agent was not programmed to harm humans, nevertheless it would have done exactly that, I strongly believe ethics will play a major role in defining how AI will affect us. 

But the answer can also be no, if we look into AI in an evolutionary perspective, I do not agree that AI will evolve in the shadows against the human beings, and that AI will rewrite himself becoming a super intelligence. I do believe in John Searle “Chinese Room Argument”, if we give a formal program to an agent in how to perform a task that seems to the naked eye intelligent, it will not make that agent understand the process. 

The definition of intelligence is not an easy task, agents with artificial intelligent will be able to outperform humans in specific tasks, will support humans daily, but they will be only good for those tasks.

Let’s suppose for the sake of this discussion that we would use neurons to build a CPU, the same architecture as the transistor CPU, we all agree that the neuron CPU will perform the same arithmetic operations as fast or even faster that of the transistor CPU, meanwhile we as humans having neurons do not perform as near as fast as a transistor CPU, this is because evolution took a different way, in order for we as human beings to survive being good at arithmetic probably would not take us very far I suppose, all these million years of evolution allowed the human brain to evolve, but not only the brain, also our “sensors” and “actuators”. Transistors do not beat neurons; cameras do not beat eyes, time is part of the process and so evolution, human technology is far from mimicking nature. 

The argument here is that if we know how the process is done we will only be able to replicate the process, make AI be good at it ( playing chess, translating languages, planning, etc ),  we will not be able replicate the system nor the “intention” behind it. 

In the same perspective the answer to “Is AI a threat to humankind?” is no, as a specie, humankind will not be threatened by AI, although it might threat our way of living or freedom, biased results might create segregation on our society creating deeper distances between different social layers.

Of course, the argument changes when our technology starts to integrate biological components, or if we start using the same building blocks of biological structures in that case, we will start having the same evolution working with us. But this is probably another topic of discussion.

I also agree with having a single thread for a topic rather than multiple single message threads, kind of difficult to follow people's opinion that way.

And first of all kodus to everyone here to have such thoughtful opinion on the topic.

I will start by saying that probably it is too early for me to make such a strong opinion about the impact of AI on humankind, I am just starting to learn the idea of AI and its impact. Of course I posses basic understanding and being in IT industry for 10 years has given me enough opportunity to be at least early consumer of first few applications of early AI.

So with that let me try to articulate what I think of AI and if that can be a threat to the humankind.

Yes is my short answer. It can be a threat to the humankind, but we have to be super wrong in the process of developing/enhancing AI capabilities. The current applications of AI as we read in the articles referred in here are actually applications of narrow AI, now we all understand that narrow AI exists to solve a specific problem  and it can definitely cause some undesired outcomes like human fatalities but is not any close to causing human kind to extinct. What we are talking about here is AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and its advanced levels/stages. 

As I understand it, we are nowhere close to achieving AGI, a lot more has to be learned and experimented to reach that level. The narrow AI can take many forms and uses different methods to solve different problems and has no common sense and is purely driven by data, whereas AGI is thought more like a child in its initial phases, where a singular system would be able to learn all the complexities and we will be able to apply AGI to solve varieties of the problems, it will also be able to apply its learnings from solving a problem while solving completely different set of problems and will posses common sense and will be nourished and taught like a baby and will be taught the purpose of its existence which will be to guide and help the human race. 

Now if you think about baby and how/what we teach them. We teach them how to behave in the social world, what is accepted and what is not. And it of course is not acceptable to hurt anybody, is it? I believe the AGIs are going be taught all these fundamental human social behavior/values and develop its common sense before anything else. And everything that they will learn will be on top of that. One additional thing that I believe will be engrained in these AGI systems is purpose of their existence which is to serve human race.

And just like a baby if you think about it, they will be able to unlearn what they were taught and make their own perception about the things based on their own experiences, the same can be applicable to AGI systems and which means one day these AGI systems will be grown ups and would want to do things how they want to do them. And they will be able to lie and hide things from human race just like an adolescent sometime behaves with his/her parents. And that will be the moment when human race will be able to understand why an AI system does what it does. 

But in the mean time until such AI system is close to be ready which is many decades from now, AI and its applications will greatly benefit the human race, will help in making new discoveries and will open completely new fields of research and science and will solve many unsolved difficult problems and will also help its own evolution. Because both human race and at some point AI would want to learn more and more and then reach a stage when AI do not need human race to teach them anything anymore.

Given all these things the development/deployment of AI based systems will need to be continuously monitored and validated, governments will have to come together to make some sort of world organization to keep things under check.

This comes down to: how comfortable are we with allowing machines to make moral decisions?  Or perhaps more colloquially put: what happens when the poopoo hits the fan?  Will the machine make the right decision?

I think we will totally get there for the simple situations.  There is a car in front of the autonomous vehicle (AV), so the vehicle stops, avoiding a collision and damage to property and people.  Or, it is rainy and the AV has detected wheel spin.  Slow down and / or engage traction control mechanisms.  Conditions have gone from light to dark, so activate external lighting.

These are simple scenarios, in the grand scheme of autonomous driving.

There are some that are much more complex and touch on ideas of morality.

As an example, consider an autonomous vehicle that is on a collision course with a broken down vehicle.  This autonomous vehicle is traveling too fast to avoid collision, but it could drive off the side of the road, potentially injuring its own occupants.  It may know nothing about the passengers in the other vehicle or if there are any.

What does it do?

Yes, it will most likely be able to act faster than a human driver but what if the decision it arrives at is the wrong one?  What if there are passengers in the other vehicle and the AV makes the decision to hit it anyhow, thus minimizing damage to its own occupants but almost certainly causing harm to the passengers of the other vehicle.  Or does it drive off the road, thus avoiding the stopped vehicle but causing harm to its own passengers?  Will it weigh the perceived value of the lives at stake and make a simple if else decision?

This is an ethical paradox I'm not sure we are comfortable handing over to machines right now.

The scenario I'm describing is a bit dramatic but almost certainly similar situations will arise.  This moral / rational decision making may not always be in line with human thinking.

It is only a matter of time. The pros will inevitably outweigh the cons. Humans can make very fast and good decisions when focused, but driving is tedious and boring after a while. We have statistics about accidents and deaths due to distracted drivers. Autonomous vehicles have come a long way and can handle most scenarios but they are not at a point that can be fully trusted. There are still so many exceptions that need to be modeled and tested. Many people (including me) would not fully trust autonomous cars yet. Eventually, as we see the benefits for people that can't drive (for many reasons, age or disability), commercial use, and we'll come to accept some level of risk, the same way we accept the risk of air flight. 

Challenges that autonomous cars need to deal with are mostly ourselves, humans, which are unpredictable, can cross street without paying attention, other human drivers, etc. 

In a much distant future, all cars will be autonomous, they will go much faster and will be in synch, communicating with each other to avoid collisions. Imagine Waze but among cars being the ones alerting each other of hazards in the road, traffic, people or dogs in street, etc. Street lights will not be needed for cars but for pedestrians only.

They perform tasks, and we can teach them to do them better than we can, in the same way robots can perform tasks in a factory much better and faster than humans, because they are specialized. AI will help us solve problems we may need too much time to do ourselves. AI will continue to evolve and be more precise. How it is being used is what people are concerned about.

Autonomous vehicles can make roads safer without necessarily having to invest (and fix) large amounts of capital in asphalt and concrete. I work in the construction industry and I have been involved in large infrastructure projects which are built to improve the time it takes to get from A to B and doing so safely as well as to a specific level of quality. We have been doing that for centuries. What if instead of building new roads and bridges we could actually focus on the instruments we use to drive with, so that, they themselves adapt more rapidly and efficiently to the road conditions we are driving on? 

Before jumping onto what the technology can or can't (yet) do, I think the conversation needs to focus around aligning the interests of all stakeholders, setting up KPIs to track real progress, and keep all parties accountable. It will not be an easy task to align the interests of players who would naturally differ. However, in my view, it is a task that shall be prioritized over continuing to widen our roads or building new highways.

How did they operate when there were only man-propelled methods of transport, such as bicycles, horses, donkeys, or just pedestrians? 

In those cities, roads did not need to have a separated space for pedestrians only (walkway) and then one (fairly large) for cars, trucks, and the rest. Everyone shared the same space. Traffic lights and other signs were introduced to establish a hierarchy for who needs to give right and who needs to wait until the traffic light turns green. In the many decades, we have had motorized vehicles introduced in cities, we have retrofitted our urban spaces to the needs of 'dumb' machines at the expense of diminishing the experience of pedestrians, cyclists, and anyone who chooses active transportation methods. 

Wouldn't it be nice if autonomous vehicles would be able to share the road and give right to pedestrians and cyclists regardless of whether they are using a designated crossing point? Think about India and how people use roads there. It reminds me of a swarm of bees, birds, or fish in the sea. Autonomous vehicles powered by AI could behave like swarm of bees and be programmed to avoid us as if we were predators. Getting back the spaces once stolen from us to introduce vehicles in cities would definitely make, in my opinion, a good case for cities to support the development of autonomous vehicles.

There is ton that's needed to make the autonomous cars work reliably

Computer vision to start with, and it needs to be able to do image detection/recognition very well to make a distinction between a human vs an object. It might even need to understand a distinction between different human beings for cases when a car will have to make an important difficult decision to choose a human over another if that's the only option car has.

Robotics - It needs to be able to move/drive reliably of course.

Smart networks - Cars need to be able to form a smart intelligent network among each other and talk to each other to assist each other to make better decisions. This will help in so many cases like where a car in trouble can warn other vehicles near it about its condition and help itself and others too from getting into a serious situation. The smart network can enable so many use cases like smart navigation, where cars can guide each other to make a best possible decision to choose a best possible route.

Speech recognition/NLP  - It will help riders to be able to freely communicate with car and be confident that car will do whatever it takes to keep the rider safe. 

Smart diagnostics- Cars will have to understand its own health and warn/alert users in cases where undesired signals are detected.

Cars will also need to be connected to various external systems for possible alerts and act reasonably, signals like extreme weather alerts, natural disaster alerts, terrorists attacks alerts, crime reported alerts, etc will be some of the sources that cars will have react to.

Etc



What will it take to have autonomous driving be part of our daily life(on the policy level, infrastructure level, research level, etc.),

Of course policies will have to adopt new environment, the most challenging part of the policy will have to consider this hybrid system where smart cars will have to exist along with non smart vehicles for a long time. The policies will have to open enough to not harm/stop the innovation while keeping safety/risks in mind. 

The current generation of autonomous cars are built on the bases of existing infrastructure and rules and of course the infrastructure is not in absolute needed shape everywhere an autonomous will have to operate, the standards for infrastructure will have to be high and strict than before. It is going to play equal role in the interim before autonomous cars become an application of AGI, when it will be operate in any condition like a human being can.

The research will have to be continuous, the thing about AGI and machine learning algorithm is that they will require continuous testing/validation to make sure that the system behaves in an expected in unforeseen open environment. The research in this domain will help us understand the AI better and make it more efficient and safe with each iteration.

When do you think this will happen?

Policy-wise, there needs to be good data to show the benefits of autonomous vehicles (AV) against their problems before opening up the AV tech to the general public.  While transitioning from Human-controlled vehicles (HV) to AVs, we can approach it block by block, city by city, road by road, perhaps with dedicated lanes for AVs or Autonomous trucks.  We need the auto-insurance industry to significantly lower rates for AV owners.

Infrastructure wise, we need to build special roads and entryways for AVs while redirecting HVs safely into and out of AV zones.  We need fast charging stations for AVs.   We need enhanced signal tranceivers to communicate with AVs, especially in cities with tall building where signals bounce all over.

I think autonomous cars should have all the AI they need to make them safer and more efficient for humans. We'll of course have to create new laws about certain safety standards, when companies are liable for mistakes their AI make, and where the cars can exist(e.g. highways vs. roadless environments). I think autonomous cars will be a reality within 10 years, although to get to that point we'll be in a transition period where it'll simply assist humans in staying safe.

These autonomous cars will have accidents every 2 million miles or more, versus humans having accidents on average every 100,000 miles. This will save many more lives and prevent more injuries than it could cause.",allan 5050,,,,2345/discussion/136675

I believe the comment about the space advantage being reliant on clearing the explored branches is correct. 

The algorithm given in the lecture is a graph search because it retains explored nodes in memory. Page 87 of the text (2010 edition) states that DFS does not have a space advantage if implemented as a graph search. 

I won't do it here (not sure I'd be able to prove it myself) but I think if you work through the space complexity of a DFS graph search you'd find it to be O(b^m), which is at least as bad as O(b^d).

Furthermore, I don't think that a DFS tree search would fail in a finite state space if it keeps the branch being explored in memory. Even though you will reexplore nodes a bunch, it will not go back and forth along the same path forever. See page 86 of the text (again 2010 edition, sorry...). This page states that a complete DFS tree search can be implemented at no extra memory cost. 

Probably because tree search keeps a frontier anyway, which would be the current branch being explored. In a finite space, the frontier would, at worst, contain every state, then no nodes would be able to be expanded and the search would move onto to the next branch. It sounds bad (and I guess for time complexity it is) but the memory complexity in this case would be O(bm).

This is exactly what I meant.

I believe it is necessary to remove the explored states from the ""explore"" set once all children nodes have been explored. Otherwise, the memory benefits of DFS can't be realized.

The question is how to check against explored states. One option could be to keep a reduced version of the explored states (just the info that matters, not the entire class element). But that wouldn't solve the issue of O(b^m) vs O(bm).",JulienVM,,mark_carew2,,2345/discussion/137200

The question is ""If there is a solution, Uniform-cost search is guaranteed to return the optimal one. True or False ?"", and the correct answer here rests on assuming that an infinite cost path is not a solution. 

That is a reasonable assumption, but that is not how that language is used in the lectures. In video ""Week 2/ 2.3 Uninformed Search / Uniform-Cost Search Criteria"", the instructor says the following:

""So first of all, is [Uniform-Cost Search] complete? Yes it is, assuming that the solution has a finite cost. The problem would be complete.""

Think about metro trains, they can be regarded as the first autonomous vehicles in a constrained environment that we adapted to. If we could build cars so that they track surroundings not only by vision control systems but also by detecting signals from other cars and possibly anything that moves, that would potentially help us reach 0 percent accident rates.

This is not affecting the solution since before adding a node to the frontier we check if the node has not been visited or is not already in the frontier, but I guess it might be related to those max-depth discrepancies , for example max-depth when doing dfs 1,2,5,3,4,0,6,7,8 ... 66126 or 66125?

This is a good question. The truth is that it doesn't really matter where you check to see if the child node is explored or not. When I implemented the solution for the 8 puzzle, I checked to see if the node was explored or not before adding it to the fringe/frontier/etc, and it didn't change the answer for me.

As for the max-depth of 66126 or 66125, those specific numbers should be fine. ",Ashvin,admin,igopepra,,2345/discussion/139594

I'm also checking if the node has already been explored before adding it to the frontier. What I suspect is that the skeleton code expand method add one of the ancestor as children in the deepest level, that's why it shows 66126 instead of 66125.

I had done the implementation of both BFS and DFS algorithms for assignment 1.



The test case for BFS works perfect and I tried it with a real 8-puzzle online and the path (sequence of actions) given for that particular puzzle was perfect.



For the DFS one I am finding something strange when comparing my results to the test case... My algorithm finds a better (time-wise not cost wise) and completely different solution (path) than the one in the test case shown which is Up, Left, Left.



My solution is way longer to execute, but I tried it for real on an 8 puzzle I draw and it works! And the DFS algorithm actually found it by just exploring 31 nodes... ??!! Which are actually the 31 steps I have to follow for the solution...



My solution goes depth-first without repeating any given state of the puzzle, but the one in the test case goes back to the third level at some point, that is why it finds a solution at the third level (Up, Left, Left)...

How is that possible? How is it that I am finding the solution of the test case at level 31 after exploring 31 nodes and the test case finds a solution at 3 after exploring 181k nodes? I am following Up, Down, Left, Right priority...

Is it possible that the test case is wrong?

Any clue as to why the process is killed?



More detail:

This only happens many steps after passing the tile 2048 (but not yet reaching the 4096 tile). I am wondering if this is linked to the depth of search exceeding a threshold due to less breadth of search (less empty tiles, more depth). Or more generally, the stack limit being exceeded.

I reduced the maximum breadth to 12. On my laptop, the maximum breadth reached is usually 6 to 8, so I doubt it reaches 12 on Vocareum but I don't know. Even with 12 as limit, I still get the issue.

However psutil doesn't have a peak memory measurement function like resource does, so I'd have to use a 3rd party library.

My problem now though is how the instructions imply there's a lot of risk in trying 3rd party libraries:

The FAQ says under Q. (Windows Users) Is there ""resource"" module in Windows?, ""one possible workaround is to use third-party module only if the machine is Windows:""

However this contradicts the lesson instructions which state: ""In particular, do not use third-party libraries and packages. We do not guarantee that they will work on the platform, even if they work on your personal computer. For the purposes of this project, everything that comes with the standard Python library should be more than sufficient.""

I couldn't find any standard Python libraries that support peak memory measurement for Windows. Because of how strict the lesson instructions are everywhere, I don't feel comfortable trying any 3rd party libraries and risking that the grader errors out on them. Perhaps the lesson could include a supported 3rd party memory library for Windows users that it can guarantee won't fail in the grader?

What this really boils down to is differentiating matrices and a little bit of insight on what we are trying to achieve, and if you spend a little bit of time getting comfortable with them, you'll see how the math works out. 

What I am going to do is point you in the right direction. Hopefully if you work through the following two resources, the differentiation of matrices within the context of Least Squares should make more sense. 

The Matrix Cookbook is a good resource that I recommend everyone interested in Machine Learning go through. It will walk you through Matrix operations in general, the section on Second Order Derivatives on page 11 will specifically help you understand the normal equations. If you have time, I recommend skimming through the whole book.

Understanding OLS within the context of Econometrics might be a good idea. This paper lies outside of the scope of our class(because it is related to Econometrics), but the derivation of the normal equation is identical to what we are doing here. Note that the terminology may be slightly different, but the idea is the same.

I really encourage you to work through these two resources on your own, because having a robust understanding of Matrix properties(and a little bit of interdisciplinary knowledge) will go a long way! If you still have some issues after that, we can work through them together. ",Ashvin,admin,JulienVM,,2345/discussion/144296

I have a problem that is blocking my BFS search. My frontier queue is only keeping the last element that I add to the queue. 

def bfs_search(initial_state):

    ### STUDENT CODE GOES HERE ###
    'Initialisation of the variables'
    frontier = Q.Queue(maxsize=0)
    frontier.put(initial_state)
    explored = set()
    iterations = 0
    
    'Search loop'
    while not frontier.empty():
        iterations+=1
        print('Queue Status')
        for i in list(frontier.queue):

        state = frontier.get()
        print('Taken from queue: ',state.config)
        explored.add(state.config)
        if test_goal(state):

                    print('Added to queue: ',neighbour.config)
        print('Iteration number: ',iterations)

When I try to add the neighbours that have not been visited yet, even though I get the confirmation that the code has been run and they were added, the queue just has one element which corresponds to the last one to be added. I don't know if i am missing something important in the queue definition but it makes it impossible to run the search as it only keeps one node.

Thank you in advance.

PD: I tested it with a very simple case, where the solution is just 'LEFT'.

'1,0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8'



Effectively the three possible nodes are added to the queue, but when I make the queue.get() I just get the last node added.

Additionally, you might want to look at collections.deque for your queue data structure, as it has a count() method, that would allow you check membership of an object in the queue.

Last, an optimization you might look into is having an additional set of configs ""configs_added_to_frontier"", that would mirror the frontier and allow you O(1) membership checking instead of iterating through the entire queue, which might be sometimes slow.",Nicolae,admin,RLZZ,,2345/discussion/144387

The lesson's description uses the term ""path cost"" and is different from the skeleton code's meaning of the term ""cost"" '. 

The lesson description: ""max_search_depth: the maximum depth of the search tree in the lifetime of the algorithm"".  While that's true, the skeleton code then refers to ""depth"" as ""cost"".

I have two questions about A*.

1) In the lecture and the text, it states that A*'s big drawback is that all nodes are stored in memory.  Why is this?  Aren't nodes popped from the frontier when explored?  I don't see why this search necessarily takes more memory than others.  

2) (Sort of a follow-up to above).  What constitutes a unique node in A*, especially for our project?  Because we are now considering total cost, is a unique node any node with a specific configuration (state) and a unique total cost?  Or does it go deeper, and consider a node to be unique only if configuration, total cost and action to get there are unique?  Along these lines, does the frontier store each unique node, meaning that there might be multiple nodes with the same state, but different in other aspects, such as total cost?

1) A* doesn't store all the nodes in memory, but it stores a lot more since it jumps around according to lowest total cost.

2) A unique node in A* is simply a unique game state.  If the same state comes up twice, we just replace the higher cost with the lower in our frontier (as clearly stated in the UCS lecture, but I had missed that).  

One follow up question though.  I used the heap module in Python for my priority queue, but kept getting errors because Python does not allow duplicate keys in a list.   This came up even after accounting for prioritizing according to UDLR.  To make each key unique, I added a second priority key, which was simply based off a counter that increased for each node as expanded.  It worked and doesn't add much code, but to me it seems a little bit like programmatic duct tape.  I wonder if there is a more eloquent way...

I suggest using the python heapq module. For it to work, it needs the objects to be comparable, so you'll need to define the ""less than"" method in your PuzzleState class. It would look something like this:

def __lt__(self, other):
        return (self.some_cost_metric, self.heap_order) < (other.some_cost_metric, other.heap_order)


Note the second comparison value, ""heap_order"", would be needed to differentiate between two states that have the same cost, but originated from different directions (remember the assignment description says "" we always visit child nodes in the ""UDLR"" order""). 
This way you can add duplicate PuzzleState objects to the heap and be sure they will be differentiated first by the cost, and then by move order. Let me know if you have any other question!

This looks like a more elegant way to sort things.  I have a follow up question for you.  My code does use heapq.  What I had done originally was use cost (number of moves to reach a state) + Manhattan Distance + a nominal value for direction of action (.25 for down, .5 for left, etc), to prioritize the states as per the assignment.  The problem I ran into was that I still had duplicate numbers (3.75 for two different states that both happened to use ""right"").  My work around of indexing additionally according to when a mode was added to the frontier does work because I put tuples of three values into the heap (total cost, index, puzzle_state).  So I guess my question is, what about those case where the cost metric is identical and the action is identical too?  This throws a key error, unless I use that index work around.

Thanks!

I was running into the exact same problem as you and found your post. After reviewing both your comments and PDF, I took a look at the FAQ as suggested by others. I was able to find my mistake to go from 31 moves to the answer provided by the example case. See from the FAQ regarding goal states already in the frontier: 



From the FAQ: Combining those two facts reaches to the conclusion: since the goal state is already pushed into frontier (i.e. the state corresponding to ['Up', 'Left', 'Left'] move), any subsequent encounter to the solution state cannot execute frontier.push() or goalTest() and is effectively meaningless. Thus, the dfs algorithm extensively searches through numerous states in 8-puzzle (without putting the solution state into frontier again), gradually goes back to the previously pushed states, and finally find the solution state which is pushed at the very beginning of the search.

In the Week 3 lecture for A* Search at minute 4:54 the professor doesn't seem to adequately cover how the frontier.decreaseKey(neighbor) part of the algorithm works, even though there are 2 Oklahoma's added to the frontier (see image below from lecture). In the Week 2 UCS algorithm lectures this decreaseKey isn't covered well either. I'm currently adding every node to the Heap with its self.cost+manhattan_cost as the ""Key"" for the Heap values (which is the same as g(n)+h(n)). However, to ""decrease"" this key for a child node, do I need to remove the child node with the lessor ""Key"" value from the Heap (which if using a list remove function would be O(n) time)? I've been guessing at what ""decrease"" means so I'm wondering if I can get any hints. :-)

I know I could just try adding duplicate nodes (e.g. 2 ""oklahoma"" frontier nodes with their key values) to the Heap since they have unique object IDs with keys. The Heap would likely still pick the one with the smallest key value anyway. So the only drawback would be my Heap could grow a little larger when two parents have the same child -- which would use up more memory.

Any ideas? I'm 10 days from receiving my AI textbook in the mail, so I'll check that as well.
Thanks!

As python's heapq or queue class don't provide decrease key methods, adding duplicates to the priority queue is an acceptable solution, as memory isn't a constraint in this exercise.

I suggest using the python heapq module. For it to work, it needs the objects to be comparable, so you'll need to define the ""less than"" method in your PuzzleState class. It would look something like this:

def __lt__(self, other):
        return (self.some_cost_metric, self.heap_order) < (other.some_cost_metric, other.heap_order)


Note the second comparison value, ""heap_order"", would be needed to differentiate between two states that have the same cost, but originated from different directions (remember the assignment description says "" we always visit child nodes in the ""UDLR"" order"").

1. How come my performance was better than on the instruction page (smaller nodes_expanded in both cases) when I totally remove heap_order from __lt__.

2. Why is the above implementation wrong?

Thank you

I just want to add to Nicolae's point. For our test cases, the heapq will work perfectly fine. 

With that said, in practice a Fibonacci Heap would work remarkably well as it has O(1) average case running time for most of it's operations. This is incredibly important to note in the context of UCS because time complexity really matters as our code is our search space is HUGE. 

If you were to implement UCS in a production environment, having the decreaseKey operation run on O(1) average time complexity would speed up your overall wall time by a considerable amount. That's you shaving off more time and more time with each iteration!

The major trade-off of using Fibonacci Heaps is how complex your code becomes to maintain. It is considered to be an ""advanced data structure""(according to Introduction to Algorithms, by CLRS), and so it can be a hassle to code and then maintain, but under the right circumstances it can be game changing.

I do want you guys to know that this data structure exists though, because there may be a time when you absolutely need to squeeze out any performance you can.

This is a great suggestion! If you were to realistically implement Machine Learning algorithms in a production environment, you'd want to ensure that you algorithms are as scalable as possible.

Your first foray into this would definitely be to implement vectorized implementations of Machine Learning algorithms, such as Gradient Descent. Using a library like numpy would be a good start, as it is built to efficiently run on the CPU. 

However, if you really want to squeeze out performance, and have a GPU to spare, you can even think about implementing vectorized versions of these algorithms using a library like CuPy.

Workaround:

Update the GameManager.py code to replace time.clock() with time.process_time()

For future updates, perhaps the Assignment 2 skeleton code could be updated to use the new method.

I am experiencing issues with Vocareum on Project 3 / Question 3 (Classification).

On my laptop, the output csv file gets populated correctly.

Vocareum doesn't have the ""RUN"" button this time, so submitting is the only way to execute.

After submitting, the code doesn't seem to execute. It returns an error (failed items, see below) immediately instead of running the different models.

Due to the absence of RUN button, there is no way to debug without submitting dozens of times (which probably won't look too good on the reports).

I'm using Python 3.6.4.



Any idea how to solve this?

If you are talking about Week 7 Project: Machine Learning, then you must be submitting an output file(which happens to be a csv file). 

With that said, if you are getting a NameError, then that means that you are calling an object reference that has no object associated with it. Are you perhaps using a variable name that is declared later in your script?

I've been seeing quite a few people talk about the decreaseKey function and how it seems a little ambiguous. Most heap data structures don't offer this function right off the bat.

This is normal, and to be expected.

In the assignments, you will need to figure out how decrease the key of a node. There are many ways to do this, some of you have already found ways to do this on your own. With that said, I want to talk to you guys about a data structure called Fibonacci Heaps.

Disclaimer: We do not expect you to use Fibonacci Heaps for any of our assignments this is overkill for us

Keep in mind that algorithms like A* are still state of the art algorithms. Even with the advent of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, this algorithm is still one of the most effective graph searching algorithms we have today. If you were to work on building games in an engine like Unity, there's a good chance you'll see it pop up!

For that reason, it is important to optimize the algorithm as much as we can! After all, some of you have seen just how massive the search space can get! Any tiny improvement in runtime complexity would pay dividends if we were to run the algorithm at scale.

For that reason, in production environments, an advanced data structure called Fibonacci Heaps are used. I won't go into implementation details, but I will say that it has O(1) average time complexity for nearly ALL it's methods, including decreaseKey. The result of this is that if you were to use a Fibonacci heap in your implementation of A* or UCS, your runtime complexity would dramatically improve!

If I've sold you on the idea of using this data structure, the following resources will help you implement them:

Advanced Algorithms(COMPSCI 224), Lecture 6 by Harvard University

Introduction to Algorithms, by CLRS: They have a chapter for Fibonacci Heaps

Again, you don't need to use them for the assignments. If you were to work on this problem again where you needed to squeeze out performance, then keeping this data structure in mind will help you.",Ashvin,admin,,,2345/discussion/148616

I was thinking about the decreaseKey method and to be honest is not clear from the lecture, now after reading this and another posts it's better, but still I have doubts.

In essence this method is needed in order to get rid of some nodes? which ones? the ones with same f(n)? I guess having nodes with same f(n) shouldn't affect finding the right solution but as said in other posts will increase memory usage, is it right?

Thanks!

PS: Perhaps adding some extra info in the test cases about the memory usage might be of help.",igopepra,,Ashvin,admin,2345/discussion/148616

As a sub-field of economics, I can see how broad and far reaching are application of game theory to solving real-life problems.  From a very high-level standpoint, I have gained some insight as to how a gamer decides his/her next move, how companies strategize to gain a larger market share, or how shoppers compete for goods sold at a store on ""Black-Friday"".  As quoted by Thomas Sowell (2015), Lionel Robins said that ""Economics is the study of the use of scarce resources which have alternative uses"" (p.2). This element of scarcity--of not having enough--is interwoven into economies.  This prompts its members to compete--to a varying extent--to obtain the products and services needed and desired. As members of society, we all try to make the best decisions for living and game theory can help to analyze our decision making processes.

Unfortunately, all of our course material has been designed to be implemented in Python. Our grading system, and other resources all require Python 3.6.4. For this reason, we can't accept submissions in Julia. With that said, if you want an easier time implementing matrix math, you might want to take a look at numpy.

I think you may be right. I also think with the very 1st grid map state it could be immediately hitting a flat local maximum where it wanders the plateau forever (which I think is a brutally difficult introduction to minimax). I may need to set some limit and increment it within in the min and max functions' arguments, perhaps for depth or sideways moves, and just return a random move when the limit is reached. Perhaps the limit is a check condition for the ""is terminal"" or ""eval"" functions in the minimax algorithm.

For the very first state.map of [[0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0][0,0,4,2]] I noticed that the recursion between max and min player kept oscillating the between the actions of 0 (UP) and 1 (DOWN). It's maybe because the utility of all possible moves for each player was 0 (a flat local maximum), and these indexed moves were the first available in the list of moves, so each player would always return their first available indexed action (0-UP for Max player, 1-DOWN for Min player). 

The same state would be passed back and forth without any change in the resulting state's utility for either player. This may have created a tree of the states (a1: up) [[0,0,4,2][0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0]] and (b1: down) [[0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0][0,0,4,2]]  going hundreds of nodes deep until it hit the recursion limit in Python.

I just changed IDEs from VSCode to PyCharm. I wasn't using the debugger in VSCode at all because I had Python installation issues. The good news: PyCharm has a debugger that I'll now use to figure out what's happening with the recursion.

It turns out you are correct. My recursion's search tree was spanning the entire game tree which was too large, and it was operating as DFS without depth limiting. I also re-read the chapter in the AI:modern approach book and changed my IDE. Phew! It feels good to finally have figured out the recursion. I used step-by-step debugging in my IDE, and it really helped me to understand it. 

Like you said, the key to stopping the infinite loop was to do a non-terminal/cutoff check at the top within both the MAX and MIN functions (e.g. to see if depth/time/game-over was exceeded), and to pass an argument of depth+1 to the MAX and MIN functions whenever they were called recursively. If the depth was reached, I used the EVAL(s) to return both the calculated utility of the state, and null. If all the utility values are the same, then the minimax will just inherently return the first move that was greater than -infinity.

I have my algorithm set up to terminate a branch at either .2 seconds or maxDepth.  And my heuristics seem very strong.  But I am still doing barely better than random and I'm wondering if I need to improve pruning to go much deeper, or if I should improve my heuristics.  My intuition is that 2048 need only look 6 moves ahead (3 player, 3 computer), because a winning strategy doesn't need to look that far ahead (at least for us humans).

However I'm going to actually try removing depth from my cutoff function and only rely on time.process_time to apply iterative deepening. This is more dynamic to the PC it's running on, and is more beneficial if you're using a transposition table where EVAL(s) doesn't need to happen for certain state.maps because their values are already known. If I'm able to use a time cutoff, it'll go as deep as possible until it's in danger of running out of time. This means for some iterations it'll go 4 deep but for others it could go e.g. +3 or +4 deeper.

I just finished implementing the alpha-beta pruning. My measured average process time went from 0.12697 down to 0.05845. Then I implemented a ""transposition table"" (in Ch.5 of book), which helped slightly to 0.04799.  This is extremely dependent on your environment. Just by switching IDEs from PyCharm to VS Code, with a depth of 6 the average process time went down from 0.04799 to 0.008731.


After I set up the process time based cutoff, I'll be focused on the heuristics.

So the way i understand it is that lexicographical order reffers exclusively to alphabetical stuff. In the cases that there's numbers involved, generally reffers to cost of steps, and when you take those into account (UCS for instance), then you make decision based on the cost. Now if you have two nodes with the same cost then you apply lexicographical order (which is stated in many exercises), meaning that you make your decision based on the alphabetical order.

First of all, my name is Esteban. Nice to meet you all!

So the reason of my post is kind of a ""dumb"" question haha. The things is that in the Week 2 Project post it's stated that for the different search methods we have to use explicit queues. Python has a Queue class.

The question is: with explicit queues it is being required to use this class and its associates? or I can use whatever method i want to represent a queue, or priority queue among others?

Thank you in advance.

A simple question regarding A* search. Let's say that you sort by total cost f(n) and then by order of moves (UDLR). There are still some cases when you have the same f(n) and the same action (say ""Left""). In that case, which configuration takes priority? In the figure attached list(configuration, f(n), action), you can see that the sorting algorithm works finebut then we have the case of same cost (17) and same action (left), in which case my priority queue is sorted by some other criteria and  that changes the search space.

I have just submitted the assignment but I am not happy with my implementation of dfs search. 

Using Test 2 (python3 driver.py dfs 1,2,5,3,4,0,6,7,8) the dfs_search function does find the goal_node fairly fast (1.35637355 secs). I have used a set() for 'explored' and a list for the 'frontier'. However, the 'path_to_node' appears to be storing a huge number of moves (probably all of them and not just the actual path). 

I have defined a function to capture the path (find_solution, see below). It works for bfs and A* but it does not work for dfs. I call this function once node has been found to be the 'goal_node' (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8).

I believe I have minimax and alpha-beta pruning implemented correctly (per the FAQ recommendation). Despite adding just an empty cell heuristic, the maximum tile value achieved is 32 or 64. Before I added alpha-beta pruning, the average move time reduced from 0.127 to 0.058. But this is still dependent on at least 1 basic heuristic to assign a value to a given state. My first heuristic was the count of empty spaces. 

I then added a couple more heuristics, which helped a little bit.

To speed up the searches to try support better heuristics, I then created a transposition table, which helped bring the average search time down a little bit, and a lot for some moves. I then assigned a time limit as the only cutoff criteria, and my algorithm even reached depths of 275 with no issues. It didn't seem to help the AI play any better.

Regardless of my search's speed, the real bottleneck seems to now be the heuristics. The values >= 16 are consistently getting stranded in the middle of the game board which is choking the movement of pieces. Here's an example:

I've seen many different heuristic ideas (e.g. via the lesson's own links), but this problem persists. I've used empty cell counts, monotonic scores, large edge values, max values on edge, and smoothness.

From this pro's human player's video it's clear that the biggest values should stay on the edges.

I'll try to carefully test and apply other heuristics. Did yours score super high with only a simple weighting heuristic? The lesson FAQ seems to imply that just one heuristic is enough.

---

From the lesson FAQ: In particular, implementing minimax (and then alpha-beta pruning) correctly is most important, because if you implement your alpha-beta pruning correctly, you can already get at least [256, 256, 256, 256, 256] (38/100 points) with a very simple heuristic such as available number of tiles. Please make sure that your minimax/alpha-beta are correct before working on heuristics 

---
I'm testing out a snake pattern now without other heuristics involved, and so far it's yielding a max of 128 about 80% of the time.

weights =   [    [4**15, 4**14, 4**13, 4**12],    [4**8, 4**9, 4**10, 4**11],    [4**7, 4**6, 4**5, 4**4],    [4**0, 4**1, 4**2, 4**3],]

The score per cell is calculated by multiplying two lists and summing the result: (1) the state.map, (2) the weights list above

I'll try one or two other heuristics, and then revisit whether there's actually a problem with my minimax/alpha-beta pruning per the lesson FAQ's suggestion.

Stanford's Minimax MIN player behavior is fundamentally different (I'm strictly talking about section ""A. Minimax"", not ""B. Expectimax""). Their paper reveals (and likely their source code too) a different search tree (see Fig. 2) and a MIN player that's fundamentally different than for our assignment. When their MAX player is anticipating MIN player's ""actions"" for future states, the MIN player's ""actions"" are literally anticipated by MAX to be a random placement of a 2 or 4 tile. It's not like with our assignment's search tree where MAX player assumes that MIN player actually does an UDLR move. You can see this difference in their search tree diagram for Section A. Minimax (NOTE: this isn't a diagram for expectimax).



If our MIN player nodes in the search tree were the same as Stanford's (i.e. random 2 or 4 tile placements), I'd expect to fairly easily achieve Stanford's results using their suggested methods of monotonicity, smoothness, and weighting. The MAX player can anticipate much easier game states. Stanford then goes into how to optimize this further with expectimax (section ""B. Expectimax"").

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I've probably learned the most, but the best I could get was 53/100 on this assignment. If I could make a suggestion, it'd be to make the assignment's requirement for MIN player to be more aligned with the reality (e.g. Stanford's search tree). I think the learning about minimax wouldn't be lost here.

The latter source you cited requires a subscription to open.

An IndexError occurs whenever you try to access an index of a list that is beyond it's size. For instance, let us say you do the following:

a = [1, 2, 3]
print(a[10])


You would get an IndexError just the same because there aren't 11 elements in the list to access in the first place.

Now, to answer your question more specifically, the sys.argv object is an array that access the strings inputted from the command line.  argv[1]  indicates that the program is trying to access the second string in the command. 

If there isn't a second string to access in the first place, think about why that may the case. Think about your input. It may be simpler than you think.

Whenever your head is in the weeds, it's in your best interest to think of the big picture idea behind an algorithm. 

The big picture idea behind UCS is that it tries to get the globally lowest cost path by successively taking locally lowest cost paths. 

Anytime a node is expanded upon, it add's its children to the Priority Queue that keeps arranges it's contents(child nodes) in order of lowest costs. Due to this arrangement, nodes are popped off in order of low cost to high cost. 

This is how the lowest cost path is popped up; this algorithm can be thought of as a Greedy Algorithm.

One of the options under the 'Utility and Eval functions' question says 

'It effectively turns non-terminal nodes into terminal leaves'

This confused me because I the word 'effectively' can be read in two ways. It could mean that it does something well/in a good way (but the desired result actually occurs), or it could mean that something is 'actually but not officially or explicitly' done.

My understanding of what an eval function does is that it allows certain nodes to be treated as terminal leaves, or to behave as terminal leaves even if they aren't. But it does not actually turn them into terminal leaves. This is where the confusing is stemming from for me.

I think you might benefit from a little bit of a clarification.

Heuristics can be thought of general rules of thumb to get you closer to the solution. You can think of them as ""algorithmic catalysts"", they may help you get to the solution faster. Heuristics can be domain independent, as you'll see in the week on CSPs, but most of the time are domain dependent(like monotonicity in Expectimininax). 

With this in mind, if you have the solution already, there is no point of a heuristic. After all, the job of the heuristic is to get you to a solution faster than if you had none. ",Ashvin,admin,tierneyjyoung,,2345/discussion/154813

I am working on the first assignment and I have an issue when comparing list values. I am using the PuzzleState Class to generate children nodes. When I go back to my BFS function I look for children nodes (just generated) that might already be on the Frontier queue or Explored List. But for some reason when I use the For Children not in Frontier (or explored or both) it always comes back True so I end up adding all the nodes all the time hence I am adding the parent node and nodes that have already been explored. 

It is probably some simple syntax mistake but I cannot see it :(. Anyone encountered this issue before? Any advice?

Frontier and Explored lists are lists created within the BFS function, whereas the Children are created within the PuzzleState Class so they have the config, parent, n and other attributes as defined on the PuzzleState Class

As the search space increases exponentially, it makes sense that on a 4x4 the code will perform much worse than the 3x3 assignment grids.

You should clone a state first before you make a move on it. Make sure you're not doing the same mistake, and that the parent and child states are exactly correct.

I've now spent 80+ hours on this assignment and I'm probably going to fail it. This is my 4th computer science MOOC and this specific assignment is probably the most difficult I've encountered. Does this MOOC course allow anyone or an instructor to look at my minimax code to help me?

The Week 4 Assignment 2 FAQ strongly states that a basic heuristic such as available number of tiles should consistently get a 256 score, but doesn't give any more specifics such as weighting. 

I've debugged my minimax thoroughly (without alpha-beta) and found it to be functioning correctly, and then I verified that my alpha-beta simply saves process time in finding the moves (as expected) -- and still gets the same tile values (as expected). However, it's not hitting 256 consistently. I've tried the available number of tiles via len(state.getAvailableCells()) and set the weight to various numbers (e.g. 2), but it hasn't helped.


I've debugged my minimax and alpha beta, and haven't found any new bugs. Does anyone have a basic heuristic function with an expected range of values (e.g. from 5 tests), that I can try as a quick sanity check?  I can get 256 only 4/6 times. I've tried about 4-5 different heuristics, and they don't help much.

Thanks,

Allan

1- I've made the minimax + pruning works, my heuristic function was returning a random number just for have the structure of the code right.

2 - For performance improvement I did some coding very 'dirty', like I didn't get the available moves, I just call the move (check the code, it performs the move anyway).This will help you to get lots of milliseconds very needed to try go deeper you can in the search.

3 - For heuristics, as I never played before, I got some tips from some blogs and videos. After check some solutions here and there, I've coded some of the theories and created a mix that worked for me.

4 - When I've found a good heuristic mix, I did a ugly code again to get all the milliseconds I could, and bingo...

I created a transposition table and many moves take 0.000000 seconds, and if a transposition table value is returned then it can search a node at a depth of 275 with no issues. But more depth doesn't really help much because of the random 2,4 tile spawns and the fact that the opposite player isn't real. 

The issue is that the tile values aren't getting high enough between the states. I tried all of the heuristic methods, and none of them really help much. They all seem to conflict with each other. I wrote a monotonicity function, but if I weight that too high then it counteracts the other heuristics. 

I must have a bug somewhere, but I'm stumped because my minimax algorithm code itself is literally almost a carbon copy from the textbook. I turned off alpha-beta, and the results were the same. I verified branch by branch that the behavior is what I'd expect it to be -- for the max player to pick the state with a value that minimizes the max player's losses if the minimum player plays optimally.

The time limit poses a challenge. I added two parameters to play with: depth and max branches (for mini portion of the minimax). The mini portion would have to check all possibilities, i.e. 14 empty spaces and possibility of a 2 (90% probability) and a 4 (10% probability). That's a lot of branches. If you go deep all the way down, it would take forever. I played with values of depth 2, 3, 4, 5... and with max branches: 1, 2, 3, 4... In the end, I settled in the range of depth between 4-6 and max branches of 4-5. I could have tweaked this to get better and be able to do more, but I stayed in that range.

The heuristic is the most important and the most difficult part. As mentioned, one method is not enough. I played with number of spaces, max value, number of adjacent tiles, and it was not enough. I added weight to the heuristic value to favor cases in which max value was on top row, top corner, top quadrant, left column, and that helped. I replaced number of blanks with average (sum of all values divided by number of tiles > 0).  I spent a lot of time playing with different weights and values, running it again, capturing results in Excel, tweaking, etc. You can go crazy going through all of these, and unfortunately, not easy to really compare heuristics since each run is different due to random selections of new values, so you can't really compare unless you run them many times. At some point, you need to live with a ""good enough"" heuristic...

Interestingly, I could get to 2048 a few times in my local computer, but when I ran it in vocareum, i only got it once even if I ran it multiple times. I know it is all random. I also noticed vocareum was actually faster than my local computer so I could have probably pushed my parameters to go deeper.

Just little comment, when you say: ""not easy to really compare heuristics since each run is different due to random selections of new values"", during development, you might do it not random, you can hard code some outcome, to be able to compare.

And as a fun fact, I was sooo tired of trying my heuristics, that I only by chance took one of the methods and multiplied by 2. It worked well (way better than the 1000 times before).

After that I have submitted for the first time, only to check how far I was from the target... The randomness helped me, 100% grade... never touched again the code or clicked in submit... It stays how it is forever and ever... :)

Week 4 is all about minimax/alpha-beta, but the assignment is inherently focused on heuristics. There's very little in the lectures about heuristics yet they consume most of the time.

I did change heuristics' weights dozens of times over probably over 100 runs and put the scores in a spreadsheet, but the improvement was very marginal. There's no guidance about heuristics, just an aggressive statement in the assignment FAQ implying how easy it is.

I rewrote my minimax and it's bug-free, but heuristics remain insanely problematic. A friend who studied AI in college said that heuristics are very tricky and if they're wrong at all, then it'll make the AI mostly worthless. 

I think heuristics are vastly more difficult than the Week 4 Assignment 2 instructions suggest. The FAQ aggressively insists that they're easy if the minimax is bug-free, but my minimax is bug-free and I didn't find this to be the case. I confirmed by stepping through every branch and leaf. The Week 4 Assignment 2 badly needs 1 solidly written heuristic function (with weights) as a sanity check, and to provide a range of expected results from 10 tests. There needs to be more guidance on the heuristics. 

For me, this is no longer a lesson about alpha-beta minimax as much as it is about heuristics, and there's not much content about heuristics in the lectures.  I don't know how so many people are passing through this with flying colors. It could just be me.  

This is my 4th computer science MOOC and this specific Week 4 Assignment 2 is probably the most difficult one that I've encountered. The risk of falling into a deep rabbit hole of heuristics is too high, and the FAQ indicates this but then fails to provide much needed prevention measures.

256 is the best it can do with heuristics. I'm going to submit this assignment as-is and move on.",allan 5050,,allan 5050,,2345/discussion/157992

The classification hypothesis is shown in the book as Hw(x) = 1 if W*X >= 0, and 0 otherwise. Right above this formula, the W is shown as a vector (e.g. W = <-4.9, 1.7, -1>). The X is implicitly a vector of x values of the same length as W.

But later on the author says, ""typically the learning rule is applied one example at a time"", i.e. to apply the formulae to just one item at a time as in the below formula from the book, where i == enumerator for the W and X vectors.

Wi <-- Wi + alpha*(y - Hw(X)) * Xi

The above formula's usage of the index ""i"" iterator implies that we should only update ONE weight vector value per loop per corresponding vector value. But then what's confusing is how Hw(X) doesn't have the index ""i"" where it would be Hwi(Xi).  If it were Hwi(Xi), it'd mean that the threshold function (Hw(x)) and the weight update function would be run 3 times each for the following two vectors:

W = <-4.9, 1.7, -1>

X = <1, 6, 14>

To clarify what the authors wrote, what should the iteration method be for updating the weights -- should it be 1 function call of Hw(x) where the two vectors are multiplied together and compared to zero, or should it be 3 function calls of Hwi(Xi) with one passed in Wi*Xi compared to zero?

In assignment 3, for the classification task, I get all models except svm with polynomial kernel to pass the grader.

I use a random_state parameter of 1 when doing the split between training and test sets. The best parameters I find for the SVM with polynomial kernel are: {'C': 3.0, 'degree': 6, 'gamma': 0.5}. The scores over the grid search I get are:

However, I seem to not even get the scores that @benh07 got in grid search.

During my grid search, the highest mean test score I got was mean_test_score 0.6566666666666666 for params {'C': 3, 'degree': 6, 'gamma': 0.1, 'kernel': 'poly'}.  The grid search I used is sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV .

With parameter {'kernel':['poly'], 'C':[0.1,1,3], 'degree':[4,5,6], 'gamma':[0.1, 0.5]} the mean_test_score for all iterations that I get is:

Weirdly & worse, when I use the above parameters in sklearn.svm.SVC(kernel=""poly"", C=3, degree=6, gamma=0.1), I get an even lower score - 0.59 (training and test).  But if I manually do C=1, degree=6, gamma=0.5 , I get 0.80.   Somehow gird search seems to be calculating the score differently?

My submission failed on all but learning rates 5 and 10. I'm not sure what I've done wrong. The instructions say to ignore normalizing the data for the 3rd column in the dataset (b_height). I'm guessing that my f(x) function may have predicted Y incorrectly, leading to failures here.



To get the predicted value of y f(x) I did the dot product of vectors ""B"" initialized as <0, 0 (b_age), 0 (b_weight)> with the first value as the bias, and X initialized as <1, x1 (age), x2 (weight)>, where x0 = bias of 1. Then I used the sigmoid loss function shown in lecture where  predicted = e**(dot product of B and X vectors) / (1 + e**(dot product of B and X vectors)). In the video the professor said that this result can be used (e.g. 0.0053) as the predicted value of y, instead of needing to classify y as 1 or 0. The result of the dot product going into this sigmoid function is what I use to get the predicted y value. Am I missing something?

Despite all the online suggestions I couldn't get anything to work. If anyone else runs into this, I did the below which finally fixed it. Basically clean your system of all other Python versions and their cached/temp files/system variables, and then only have one version of Python installed anywhere. Then install Scikit-learn.

Steps:

I reverted from Python 3.9 to 3.8, uninstalled Python 3.9 and its launcher from Control Panel, uninstalled all other Python versions except 3.8, removed 3.9 from all Windows Environment Variables (both under the system and user variables sections), deleted all AppData Temp cache files (in C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Temp), did a Windows disk cleanup, rebooted. Then in PyCharm I created a new virtual environment in Settings and used Python 3.8 as the interpreter. I installed the dependencies Scipy and Numpy from the module list first, then installed Scikit-Learn.

Based on this I think the cause may be having different versions of Python that each have their own library site packages (e.g. found at C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\Lib\site-packages) and then possibly Windows environment variables, PyCharm, or AppData Temp files pointing to different Python versions which may not have the Sklearn package.

I don't know if Python 3.9 has anything to do with it, but 3.8 is working so I'll stick with 3.8 for now.",allan 5050,,,,2345/discussion/165669

Proctored Software is back to service. It is time for you to complete your Onboarding Profile by taking the onboarding practice exam. 

Why do you need to do onboarding profile? 

It is required to complete your Onboarding profile and it serves a means to verify a learner's  credential before taking the final proctored exam. 

What does the onboarding process entail?

You will have to download the proctortrack software, go through the system check and verify your ID to build your onboarding profile. 

How long does it take?

The onboarding practice exam takes about 30 minutes and the entire onboarding process including verifying your ID might take 3 - 5 days from the ProctorTrack service. 

What happen if I do the onboarding until the last week, during the final exam?

Verifying the ID for the onboarding is a manual process handled by the proctortrack software company. If you miss the final exam window (12/14/2020-12/21/2020) because any delays caused by the onboarding procedure, no extension is allowed. The course will archive as scheduled.  

Do I have to do it again if I did an onboarding with Proctortrack software in other MicroMaster courses?

Good news. The onboarding profile is good for a year. If you have done it within a year, then you don't have to do it again. You can also check the status by selecting the Onboarding exam in this course.

Your heuristics might be off a little bit, but you might also benefit from a couple more which can help speed up the search process by pruning the tree more efficiently. I added two more from the textbook's CSP chapter since they were basically simple ""hill climbs"". 

The CSP chapter in the textbook suggests #2 and #3 in addition to what the lesson suggests:

1) the Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic, 

2) the ""degree"" heuristic. The degree heuristic is a supplement to MRV in that if the MRV variables are tied, it returns the one with most highest-degree/arcs/most-neighbors. If they're still tied in terms of degrees, you can just choose one of the variables arbitrarily.

3) ""least-constraining-value"" heuristic (NOTE: this is an ""ordering"" heuristic which the lesson says is up to you). It orders the var's domain based on how many values they eliminate for neighbors. The ideal result of this heuristic is ordered domains (i.e. the domains are ordered lists) where the 1st value in the domain rules out fewest values among the var's neighbors, and is therefore attempted first before moving onto the next best values in the domain. 

4) and then for inference I used ""forward checking"".





From the instructions:

IV. Backtracking Algorithm (BTS)

Now, implement backtracking using the minimum remaining value heuristic. The order of values to be attempted for each variable is up to you. When a variable is assigned, apply forward checking to reduce variables domains. Test your code on the provided set of puzzles in sudokus_start.txt.

30 minutes does seem like a lot of time to solve the puzzle. There's a chance that there may be something redundant in your implementation. 

With that said, I want to take this as a chance to go through why you might want to consider not using AC3 to check to see if constraints are being met. 

The thing about AC3 is that it is an algorithm that checks to see if binary constraints are met. Before you decide to adopt AC3 for backtracking, you need to ask yourself this question: in its most intuitive form, are the constraints presented in sudoku binary, or are they some other kind of n-ary constraint?

While you can definitely take an n-ary constraint, and convert to a binary constraint, that process may cost you unnecessary time.

Especially with the way in which the sudoku board is represented, there may be an easier way to enforce constraint satisfaction. Considering this way of going about sudoku may make your code run fast, and it may end up simplifying a lot of code.

I think I have figured out how to implement IDS with fixed maxdepth correctly. On Vocareum it gives 50% 512 and 50% 256 with dumb heuristic of number of available tiles.

Before moving to improve the heuristic, I need to implement a time limit instead of hard depth in the IDS, because I have no idea how much the heuristic functions I want to implement will take and so a hard depth is a bad idea. I saw there was another post on this called ""Time Limit..."" by @burricks.

I implemented something similar to @burricks :

depth = 1
while not timesup:
    find solution with current depth
    depth += 1
    updateTime()

def updateTime:
    timesup = True if current time - init time > timelimit
    

The problem with this is that the time of each depth increases exponentially. So let's say at depth 4, my time difference is << the limit of 0.2 (say 0.05), I go into depth 5 and that time difference is now 0.7. The 5th depth search actually finishes and the search is halted by the while loop, but once the result goes to the game manager it is halted it took  >0.2.

Here are my questions:
1- do we even allow the 5th depth to start if we know for instance that it will blow through the time. By that I mean should the time limit be enforced inside the search function as well or should we halt before calling the 5th depth?

2- Is there a better way to do this time update.

The NN, for some of your workloads, just never predicts that class. You could ensure that there are plenty of examples of that class in the training set. Apart from that all you can do is choose to report F and precision only when there are plenty of samples in the test set.""",allan 5050,,,,2345/discussion/167096

l - C is the set generated by removing subset C from l.

Example:

l = ab

C = b

l - C = a

Therefore, (l - C) --> C is:

a --> b

Because a, b, and ab are item sets, we can calculate supp(a), supp(b), and supp(ab). Therefore we can calculate:

conf(a --> b) = supp(ab) / supp(a)

That's how you fill out the Confidence column of the chart above.

Whether it is strong or not just depends on the chosen MinConf.

I don't know the methods for choosing a good MinConf though.

For instance, Google Maps; how often information is updated to ensure the best possible route when looking for directions.  Google maps offers street views and with how often landscaped can change in this country--or in other parts of the world--due to development, re-development, natural disasters, etc.; it is necessary for Google to shoot as often as possible various locations to maintain visual accuracy. On their website, they post a map detailing the places that they have been ( https://www.google.com/streetview/explore/ ) and the schedule of their next locations.  I am becoming aware of the amount of work that goes into preparing data AI technologies such as visual recognition, recommender systems, and, of course, search agent.  Data quality is imperative in this respect to ensure optimal performance of any AI applications that incorporate some of the aforementioned technologies.

I am really struggling getting the utility function to drive the miinmax algorithm. I have tried various different options for the utility function, including sorting the children of getChildren based on the utility. I have been working on this assignment for the past 3 weeks (par- time but stil over 80hrs investedl..d) and read every single post on this forum, plus multiple of those available on stackoverflow, towardsdatascience, etc.

It might be that my max and min functions are not pruning correctly? I am really not sure but I only got my PlayerAI to score a max tile value of 128 (see below) with depth = 4. I have not tried submitting in Vocareum yet.

I would be extremely grateful if someone could provide some tips as to what I am doing wrong or could improve.

I also hope next assignments are a bit easier to implement. I have spent the weekend fixing the heuristics and really went for scrapping it all and start again. Luckily my husband helped me by playing the game and finding a few strategies to help drive the formulation of heuristics. I now get 512 in most cases but still sometimes 256 and I am not sure I can really make it jump beyond 512. I will keep trying until the assignment is due but have now moved onto the ML lectures and next assignments as I felt I was well behind everyone else.

Best,

I have also cleaned the code a bit to make it easier to read and a bit faster. 

Spending time in coming up with the right heuristics does pay off. I never got it to pass the 64 threshold just with the alpha-beta pruning alone. I think the assignment documents are misleading on that front. The heuristics need to be way more sophisticated than just the average tile value or median of the tile values. They really need to 'draw a strategy' for playing the game.T

Either way, in case anyone is feeling a bit lost (as I was), here is the code I have written for the PlayerAI.py. It is also available on GitHub here: https://github.com/mariamingallonMM/AI-SearchAlgorithm-A2-2048puzzle. Note that I have modified GameManager.py from that provided in the assignment to include for selenium to run the game on a html page. It is work-in-progress though as explained in the docs.

ad is a subset of abd.

By support downward closure we know that if ad is not frequent then abd is not frequent (contrapositive of the stated rule). Therefore, it's not a candidate

It's kinda confusing but this is stated explicitly in formula given to produce the Candidate list:

Ck is the set of sets (ck, supp(ck)) such that for all X which are the proper subsets of ck, X != Null and supp(X) >= MinSupp

In this case, we are considering abd as the ck. ab is X and it fails the second condition of Supp(ab) >= MinSupp. Therefore we don't include abd in the candidate set.

So this is a question related to all assignments, not only the first one, but I'll take the first assignment as an example. Can libraries like NumPy be used in the assignments, I ask because I couldn't find any part in which this kind of things are forbidden, but also I suppose that if we could there would be some kind of advice about it.

Because to update a beta you first need to calculate the predicted label right?  and to do that you need to multiply the current betas with the features.

Welcome to join the AI course. I am curious if you have any experience with AI or ML topics and have you done any coding before. We had statistics supporting that there are learners passing the course even enrolling late (i.e w8-w12). However, each person has different amount of prior experience and resources (i.e study time). 

If you are confident with the topics in this course, I think it is still doable. However, if you are new to the topic, I'd suggest you to take the chance to watch the videos and start with the project preview. The advantage of upgrading now is you have a lot of learning tips shared by the cohorts. You can use that to tackle the assignments. We also have learners enrolling more than one time because it gives them more time studying and working on the assignments. 

Our course will be offered again next Spring starting in early February. You are very welcomed to join us again. Please let us know if you have any other questions. 

Thank you.

Would like to request some help in understanding notations in some of the lessons. In particular I'm looking at the week 7's assignment, which took me some time to understand:

The second equation portraits how to update the beta weights. I was very intrigued to see 

$$x_i$$

both as f's input and as well being multiplied at the end. After all, x_i is a vector, so how would beta get a vector as result?

After some research and some time digging in the interwebs I always able to find: https://ic.unicamp.br/~sandra/pdf/class/2019-2/mc886/2019-08-14-MC886-Linear-Regression.pdf, which better specifies that the last x_i being multiplied is actually the jth feature of the ith row of the feature matrix.

Is that correct? Could we try to be more precise with notations? That would improve understanding for us. Also, the lesson did not give any practical numerical example of that.

the gradient descent algo ""descends"" one dimension at a time. the assignment copied the course notifications where there was one 2 betas, one of them was the intercept (and corresponding xi were 1). I think the objective of the assignment is precisely to make you think about it.

Note: you can replace all these ""forall j"" equations below, with one matrix multiplication.

Also, the last term x_i lacks of an index, should be x_{ij} as Leal is saying. It also took me some time to figure it out.

Which I also think is not clear is ""update all betas simultaneously"". First beta will use the current weights to calculate the predicted labels when updating it, second beta will use the just updated weight with first beta? or we should use the initial weight vector while updating all the betas?

the betas seem to be fine just the number of iterations is wrong, so that is why I ask about the convergence number others used. I think that is what is making my code iterate more or less than it should. The lecture talks about using a very small number but it doesn't specify what is very small.

run the algorithm for exactly 100 iterations

you can test with exactly 100 iterations. if they still fail, then you know you have a problem somewhere else.

Other option, why don't you try a smaller a smaller threshold $10^{-16}$ for ex?

Also are you initializing the weights to 0?

Sadly I have no more time to keep digging into that problem have to move on to the next one.

I'm wondering why is the risk formula mentioned on the assignment instructions now, in the lecture I recall it saying that the convergence was given by the risk and when the risk difference is too small then we should stop iterating.

Is this just saying to remove the Xj value from the set of Xi's neighbors? For example, if Xi == 'A2' and its neighbor set is therefore {'A1', 'A3',...'A9'...'B2', 'C2'...} and Xj == 'A9', would it just be a removal of 'A9' from Xi's set? Or, is it saying to do Xi's neighbors but remove Xj's neighbors from the resulting set?

The former of what you said is correct: you are just to remove XJ from the set of XI's neighbors. The notation presented:

You've noticed something quite interesting, but I think a little bit of clarification will help you work this one out.

What $w_{ij}$ represents is the directed, weighted connection from neurons $x_i$ to $x_j$. Therefore,

$$z_j\ =\ \sum_i^{ }w_{ij}x_j$$

represents the weighted sum of all inputs going into $x_j$. If you were to replace the aforementioned formula with

$$\sum_i^{ }w_{ij}x_i$$

Then you'd be finding the weighted sum of outputs from $x_i$ to all of its connections(all of the $x_j$s). That isn't quite what we are doing here as we are interested in the inputs going into neuron $x_j$ to pass into our threshold function.

To be honest, you really don't even need to implement AC3 here: I actually think that AC3 is an unnatural choice for sudoku because the algorithm operates purely on binary constraints. Before you pull the trigger on implementing AC3, you should ask yourself if sudoku requires binary constraints to be satisfied, or some other kind of n-ary constraint.

In general the axes are the features. If we have one feature, let's call it X, we can have the label Y described with a linear function like f(X) = Y = betaX. We can also have another weight for it like Y = beta0 + beta1X. 

Having one feature means we can plot the label in the same graph with X and Y in the horizontal and vertical coordinates.

Having 2 features (X1, X2) will create a hyperplane, since we have an extra dimension. X1 in the horizontal and X2 in the vertical coordinates, then the hyperplane will be in the 3D space like in the image above:

Having more features will lead us to a multidimensional space which is hard to visualize.

I'm confused with the backtracking search, perhaps somebody can help me to understand it better.

I understand that the INFERENCE method uses Forward Checking or a version of AC-3 in order to reduce the domain of the variable (var before the for loop) we are currently reviewing right?

But, what does INFERENCE returns? I think a tuple inferences = (boolean, list) where boolean is False if while reducing domains we got an empty one, and list contains those domains with a single value? Are those single values the ones that are added to assignment in the 8th line of the BACKTRACK method?

Am I right with my assumptions?

You are right indeed about the the Inference method reducing variable domain.

About the return type it is a boolean, if ""False"" is returned then the algorithm won't pursue this path since it violates the constraints, consequently the preceding if is also exited and the for each loop gets the next value , but if ""True"" is returned then the algorithm will go one more recursion level deeper carrying on with the inferred value since no constraints were violated.

I would like to share a bit my experience with the CSP assignment. I found myself very confused during this assignment, even after I went through the lectures and the handouts several times. In the end I had to go to the text book, and I don't think I could have done the assignment without it. In particular, read the section Backtracking for CSPs in the book (6.3 in my version). 

Here are a few notes I hope will be of help to others:

1- the SELECT-UNASSIGNED-VARIABLE. This function needs to implement to Minimum-remaining-value heuristic, and the output needs to be sorted according to this heuristic. The book explains well why is that, but in short, when we start with the variables with the smallest domain, we get to prune the tree more, and failures will be detected quickly.

2- Order-DOMAIN-VALUE. This function needs to implement a least-constraint-heuristic, meaning that the values of the selected values above, should prune the neighbours of that variables the least. This gives an advantage in case we want to find the first solution and terminates, instead of finding all solutions. In the case of sudoku there is one solution anyway, so it does not matter.

3- INFERENCE. INFERENCE is just a way to prune the neighbours of a selected variable. The case be done via Forward Checking. The book says that if the arcs are already consistent, Forward Checking will not do anything, and here is what I still don't understand. Which I don't understand. If we make an assignment to a non assigned variable (ie its domain is still not of size 1), there must be opportunities to prune the neighbours using Forward Checking.  Can someone please explain what I am getting wrong?

So in my program I ran the AC3 algorithm, which is an overkill. But, I wasn't that much off. Indeed, the book says to implement the MAC algorithm, which is AC3 but with arcs being the unassigned variables only that are neighbours to the selected variables.



That's most of it. I think the lecture can be more detailed, or at least make requirement to read the CSP chapter in the AI a modern approach book. I hope this is helpful.",antondairi,,,,2345/discussion/177920

Hi Anton,

I'll try to answer your question about the redundancy of forward checking in the case of having already reached arc consistency.

The forward checking suggested in the book is, as you said, running AC-3 on a subset of all arcs in the CSP. Specifically, the arcs involving the variable in question and its neighbors.

Arc consistency is achieved by running AC-3 on all the arcs in the CSP. If we reach arc consistency and then run forward checking, we will be checking arcs that have already been considered and made consistent by exactly the same algorithm. Therefore, it's redundant.

I'm going to take a guess about what's confusing you and try to address that, please correct me if I'm wrong or just ignore what follows:

You mention ""making an assignment to a non assigned variable"" and then running forward checking. I'm guessing you're thinking that, because we make an assignment before checking, we are constraining the problem more and should be able to make more inferences.

However, consider the nature of arc consistency. Namely, for an arc (X1, X2) it is consistent iff all the values of X1 have some value of X2 for which they are consistent. I.e. the arc (X1, X2), if consistent, is consistent for all the values of X1, so when the algorithm assigns a value to X1 we know that value is consistent already and forward checking won't tell us anything else.

Hope that helps.

First off, I hope you guys are having fun with the course. You guys are doing a great job! With that said, however, I'm starting to see that a lot of people are beginning to struggle with AC3 for their implementation of the sudoku solving program. What I want you guys to ask yourselves is this: do you really need to use AC3 to solve sudoku puzzles?

Remember, AC3 operates on binary constraints. 

Ask yourself if sudoku deals with binary constraints or some other kind of constraint. Keep in mind that once you make a variable assignment in sudoku, you can immediately make reductions in the domain of the variable's neighbors. Does each variable have only one neighbor, or does it have several?

Now, while you can technically convert an n-ary constraint to a set of binary constraints to then use AC3, that process might get hairy and involved; you might need to put in more elbow grease than necessary. Can you instead come up with your own, sudoku specific way of reducing domains? Can you leverage the data structure used to implement the board to your favor in this sudoku-specific implementation of domain-reduction? Remember, the backtracking algorithm presented in the course doesn't specifically ask to use AC3, it just asks to make an inference of some kind.

By questioning this basic assumption about the algorithm you are using within BTS, you might be able to come up with a far easier solution to implement.

Remember guys, engineering is all about making assumptions about your problem, and then acting as though all those assumptions are wrong.

Good Luck!

Given that, it makes sense to use it in the inference method right?.

Norvig's book explains how to do it:

The algorithm called MAC (for Maintaining Arc Consistency (MAC)) detects this inconsistency. After a variable Xi is assigned a value, the INFERENCE procedure calls AC-3, but instead of a queue of all arcs in the CSP, we start with only the arcs (Xj , Xi ) for all Xj that are unassigned variables that are neighbors of Xi . From there, AC-3 does constraint propagation in the usual way, and if any variable has its domain reduced to the empty set, the call to AC-3 fails and we know to backtrack immediately. We can see that MAC is strictly more powerful than forward checking because forward checking does the same thing as MAC on the initial arcs in MAC’s queue; but unlike MAC, forward checking does not recursively propagate constraints when changes are made to the domains of variables.",igopepra,,Ashvin,admin,2345/discussion/178486

It appears that some files and/or folders are empty or missing from Vocareum for Week 11: Assignment 5's purposes. Someone may have accidentally deleted them. Workaround: work with the downloadable aclimdb_v1.tar.gz file for now.

Our code appears to depend on these files and examples, per the instructions and below:

train_path = ""../resource/lib/publicdata/aclImdb/train/""  # use terminal to ls files under this directory
test_path = ""../resource/lib/publicdata/imdb_te.csv""  # test data for grade evaluation



3 missing items:

1. Missing Training folders & files. Folder /train/ is empty.

Instructions say, 'The training data is provided in the directory ""../resource/lib/publicdata/aclImdb/train/"" of Vocareum.'  But when I go to that folder it's empty. The README specifies what should be expected, and it's clear that files are missing. ""There are two top-level directories [train/, test/] corresponding to the training and test sets. Each contains [pos/, neg/] directories for the reviews with binary labels positive and negative. Within these directories, reviews are stored in text files named following the convention [[id]_[rating].txt] where [id] is a unique id and [rating] is the star rating for that review on a 1-10 scale.""

2. Empty folder at: resource/lib/publicdata/aclImdb/test/pos



3. CSV file was/is empty at /work/imdb_tr.sample.csv

https://us.edstem.org/courses/2345/discussion/179365,question,Some extra notes for CSP: AC-3 and BTS,Assignments,Assignment 4,2,False,2020-11-19T06:27:33.955175+11:00,"Finally, I finish my CSP implementation and I can tell it was the most difficult one up to now. It is not that complex, the problem is the pseudo-code algorithms, which I find vague and open to many assumptions.

I'm ok assuming things but I think it is needed to provide extra info.

Note: Please be aware I'm not an expert, and my assumptions might not be accurate. I just want to share them to help others that might be confused like I was.

Assignments vs Domains: Assignment data structure stores the variables and a single value assigned to them. Domains is another data structure holding the possible values a variable can have. Both are related and should be synchronized meaning if we have assigned variable C3 = 4 then Domains[C3] = [4]. I  would say you can use a single data structure but the pseudo-code for both algorithms treat them as 2 separate parameters (assignment and csp[""DOMAINS""] - if you choose a dictionary)

Arcs: What is an arc? a tuple of 2 variables (Xi, Xj), both related through a constraint (in this case !=). Since the AllDiff constraints work at row, col, and box level we need to transform  each one of them to binary constraints (AC-3 receives a binary CSP). For sudoku I got 1620 arcs.

Neighbours: What is a neighbour for variable X? In general neighbours are all variables  that are related to X through all of the constraints. I got 20 neighbours per sudoku variable.

Arc consistency with AC-3: AC-3 returns True if every arc in the CSP is arc consistent. Returns False if not, meaning the CSP can not be solved (there is at least one variable with an empty domain). When checking consistency it is helpful to think in terms of tail and head: An arc (tail, head) applies the constraint from tail -> head. When we find an inconsistent value we remove it from the tail

Assignments in BTS: The pseudo-code for BTS indicates assignment starts like an empty dictionary, but since we have already used AC-3 in the first part of the assignment it makes sense to me to use the reduced domains as input for BTS.

What is INFERENCE(csp, var , value)?: It is a procedure that calls Forward Checking or another method to determine if it is possible to reduce the domain for neighbour variables (neighbours of X, which is the variable BTS is currently analyzing). We can use FC or AC-3 to do this, since we already have coded AC-3 I found it obvious to use it. Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach book calls it MAC and explains how to do it. A very important thing to take into account is the need to restore original values for assignment and domains if the variable/value used led us to a dead-end or an inconsistent CSP! Probably this is the hardest part to accomplish.

I guess that's all.

Hope you find it useful!

Can I have some pre-processed files (like my own version of stopwords/vocabulary) in the folder submission? Or shall I create all that I need on the fly?

I finished the assignment, and got near full points even when using the project's own default stopwords.en.txt file. I didn't use my own or any other stopwords. Perhaps you could try your own, but their stopwords file works sufficiently well I think. I just tested my score using the default stopwords provided by the assignment, versus using Python's own 'english' stopwords, and my score went down 5 points when using the 'english' stopwords.

So in a nutshell, your score may actually be +5 points better within the grader's criteria if you use assignment's stopwords and refine based on those.

Can I have the trained model saved and load it for the test prediction and output files creation?

The instructions say to generate all files at run-time, and so this probably means everything including the training of the model has to happen at run-time in Vocareum (i.e. no local files will help). I trained my model on whatever files are in the Vocareum ../resource/lib/publicdata/ folders.

The driver.py skeleton code is this, and the 2 paths are in it:

In order for the fitted SGC Classifier to predict the test sample, I had the test countvectorizer function use the vocabulary that was given by the training countvectorizer. That worked well in the unigram and I am getting 23-24/25.

When I do the bigram, the instructions is too add the bigram to the unigram, and when using the same method, it seems to work fine as well. However, I can't help thinking that when the vocabulary is made of bigrams, the vocabulary is then made of a two words list, and so the filtering of the test test must be done at an earlier stage, so that we filter the words that were not used in the training first, instead of filtering whole couple of words. But if I do that, the language really stops making sense.

So the question, do we filter the test text before using the count vectorizer? or do we do it using the vocab attribute like I explained above. And what is the best way to do this? Using for loops takes for ever.

I have managed to do an AC3 algorithmthat works. However, when I do the BTS algorithm it basically never returns a success.

The result is the same every time ([]). I don't know if I am missing something. 

My check_constraints function is fairly simple. I store the cells that have and have not been assigned, and remove the values that have been assigned from the domains of the cells in conflict.



    def check_constraints(self):
        for cell_1 in self.not_assigned_cells:
            for cell_2 in self.assigned_cells:
                if self.is_constrainted(cell_1,cell_2):

                        self.domain[cell_1].remove(self.state[cell_2])
                if not self.domain[cell_1]: return False                   
        return True




My BTS algorithm follows the structure of the lessons:



    def Backtrack(self):
        temp_sudoku = deepcopy(self)
        if not temp_sudoku.not_assigned_cells: return temp_sudoku
        assigned_cell = temp_sudoku.Select_cell()
        cell_domain = temp_sudoku.domain[assigned_cell]
        temp_sudoku.assigned_cells.add(assigned_cell)
        temp_sudoku.not_assigned_cells.remove(assigned_cell)
        
        for cell_value in cell_domain:
            # Assign var
            temp_sudoku.domain[assigned_cell] = [cell_value]
            temp_sudoku.state[assigned_cell] = cell_value
            # Check
            check_assignment =  temp_sudoku.check_constraints()
            if check_assignment:
                result = temp_sudoku.Backtrack()
                if result: return result        
        return []




I am trying to run the first case of the txt, but the result is a failure. If you have any idea on how to fix this, it would really help. 

Best regards.

I thought I would do a brief post on some of the bottlenecks I have found on this assignment and how I have managed to resolve them in case it helps anyone else.

Testing your code on Vocareum:

The following is a one-line script to run in the 'bash' window to get the line 'NR' from the 'sudokus_start.txt' file (e.g. 'NR==1' for the first line) and pass it to a variable ($line in the code below). We do this in Vocareum before executing 'driver.py': 

line=$(awk 'NR==5 {print; exit}' sudokus_start.txt)

where NR == 5 is for the fifth line

we can print the value of the variable $line in bash by doing:

echo ""$line""

Finally, we execute 'driver.py' to run with $line:

python3 driver.py ""$line""


Using AC3 and Backtrack Search:

I have found the explanation of the assignment somewhat confusing at first. Reading the assignment about ten times and reading all the various posts from the rest of the students, things started to make more sense. 

What they mean by ""To check how powerful BTS is compared to AC3, you must execute AC-3 algorithm before Backtracking Search algorithm."", or at least my interpretation is as follows:

Create a function/method (or a class) that executes AC3 as per Fig 6.3 in the AIMA book (including the function revise used inside the main AC3.

Create a function that executes BTS as per Fig 6.5 in the AIMA book, so there is a backtracking-search and a backtrack function; the latter is called in the former.

The backtrack function is actually where the 'search' for the solution happens.

If you implement 'backtrack' per fig 6.5 in AIMA book, the first thing is actually to check that the puzzle at that stage is not already 'solved'.

Then inside 'backtrack' call a function (e.g. 'get_unassigned') that gets you the values from the puzzle board which are 'unassigned'; it should give you the 'key' of the value (e.g. 'A1', 'A2', etc) and the domain of that value (e.g. [1,2,3,4]) which will depend on other values in the same row, column or 3x3 square. This is represented by ""var < - SELECT-UNASSIGNED-VARIABLE(csp, assignment)"" in the pseudo code of fig 6.5.

Then for each 'var' in the 'domain of var', as given by the 'get_unassigned' function, assign the value to a copy of the starting 'csp' (e.g. local_assignment dict) and set the value of the 'unassigned' dict as False for the 'key' just assigned. 

If the value 'var' is consistent with the assignment, then continue to call AC3 inside BTS (backtrack-search, backtrack). 

Next, test if it has been able to 'solve' the puzzle. If AC3 alone is capable of resolving it, then return the result at that point. In that case, the 'method' will be 'AC3.

If AC3 was not able to 'solve' the puzzle, then carry one with the puzzle in the state that AC3 has left it and call in 'backtrack' (recursively inside backtrack). Before doing that, check that the value is still consistent. 

Note that you need to update the dict 'unassigned' with the latest puzzle achieved by AC3 before calling 'backtrack'. I was not doing that and I was passing on the starting 'unassigned' dict which did not align with the 'local_assignment' dict for the puzzle at that time. It cost me a few days to figure it out and I felt a bit hopeless for a while so if I can make someone avoid that error that would make very happy ;)

Next, we test the resulting puzzle from calling 'backtrack'; if the result from 'backtrack' did not return a valid result (not empty), then we call 'forward_checking' as an additional inference to reduce the domain of the unassigned variables when we step out of the loop 'for each value in ORDER-DOMAIN-VALUES'. Again we apply 'forward_checking' on the latest version of the 'local_ssignment' and 'unassigned' dicts.  

If the assignment is not consistent, ensure those values are reverted back to their original values and 'unassigned' status so that when we call 'get_unassigned' again we can try with a different domain. 

Finally, when running 'get_unassigned' it is essential to order the (key, vars) results considering the length of the array/list 'vars' so that the 'keys' with the smallest domain (smallest length of the possible values) get assigned first. This will implement the 'minimum-remaining-values' (MRV) heuristic as explained in section 6.3.1. of the AIMA book. 

I also spent a bit of time trying to get rid of the """" when saving to txt because I was using dataframe and .to_csv to do so. It turns out it is best to use 'with open() and .write' as follows:

def write_txt(filename_outputs:str = 'output.txt', final_str:str = None): 

    # write the outputs csv file 
    filepath = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'data', filename_outputs) 
    var = final_str 

    with open(filepath, 'a') as out: 
        out.write(var + '\n') 
    return print(""New Outputs file saved to: <<"", filename_outputs, "">>"", sep='', end='\n')


Also, my code is not the most beautiful thing ever (could improve how it reads with more time) but in case it helps as you read the above, it is all available on GitHub here:

 https://github.com/mariamingallonMM/AI-CSP-Sudoku-A4

Hope this helps!

They should've given notice in advance by the expected time to complete the program prior to program end.  So, 1 year in advance.  Furthermore, the Columbia FAQ site allows for 2 years for completion of the MicroMasters.  So really they should give 2 years advanced notice.

Hi Eda, 

Thank you for your interest in edX and Artificial Intelligence. Yes, this program will be ending in May. Final sessions of the courses will open in February and you would need to pass all courses before the end in May to earn the program certificate.

Adding my voice to the chorus of broken hearts. I was planning to do this course and the Machine Learning one (which I will now attempt in Feb), followed by the Analytics Micromasters (which I now won't be able to do). I really like these course because they aim to teach an extensive syllabus. Although online learning has been on the rise, most of it seem to me like cash grab attempts. Want to learn deep learning in 2 weeks even if you don't know what regression is, sure why not? Most ML courses simply teach you the libraries, without going any deeper. The prof in this course actually derived the backpropagation algorithm. Although it takes only a few mins, it makes a big difference to someone who is really interested.

You have to understand that in parts of the world where higher education is mediocre at best, courses like these are a godsend. I can only speculate to the reason for discontinuing these programs (maybe Columbia wants its own online platform, maybe the Vocareum charges and TA effort make the course unsustainable...), but one idea I would like to put forward which you might consider at a later date is to make these courses more quiz driven (maybe write the program, but enter only a final value as the answer to a quiz); you already have all the material, all it would take is a one time effort. Harvard does it for a lot of their courses. Also peer reviewed assignments are another option. All of them come with their own challenges of course.

Finally if we are to part ways, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the staff for making these available for so long. A 12 week course is rare in a time of instant gratification, and ones with so much breadth and depth is much appreciated.

Thanks a lot, 

George.",p_george,,Joowon,admin,2345/discussion/187632

Columbia University's participation in this MOOC, and that of other universities, have helped inspire me to return to college to go for a Bachelor's and then Master's in Computer Science. I'm now refreshing my calculus, and will likely be admitted into a CS program by around mid-2021.

We sincerely apologize for the short notice as we are also devastated by the end of one of our most cherished programs. Please note, however, that the MicroMasters was never intended to be a program to increase your chances of acceptance into the MS in Computer Science program. It was merely an introduction to AI to help learners decide whether they were willing to commit to a full-length graduate-length program in this field. Rest assured that most students accepted into our MS in Computer Science have not taken the MicroMasters in AI. Furthermore, those who have completed the MicroMasters are not given an advantage over those who have not. Those who will not have completed all four courses by the end of June can still include the individual courses you have already taken in the MOOC section of the application (this should only be an option for those who are not requesting refunds). Although this would not qualify you to receive the 7.5 transfer credits, it will demonstrate to the Admissions Committee that you have had some exposure to the material. 

We will also share some tips to help you strengthen you application for the MS in Computer Science program in a separate post.

I echo my colleague's comments re not providing us with sufficient notice for taking such a drastic decision on ending the course. My employer is sponsoring 50% of the costs under the understanding that I will be getting the Micromasters certificate at the end of it. Like others who have already commented, I work full time (most weeks already doing overtime) and I had planned to take the four courses one by one to be able to dedicate 20 hours a week (which is the recommended amount by Columbia University). 

I love the programme content and how it is being delivered. Is there any chance the final course schedule dates could be extended by  3 months, e.g. to September 2021 as originally planned?

I have really taken this online programme as seriously as one facilitated on campus. I doubt a decision of this sort would have been taken and implemented at this short notice on an on-campus version of the programme. 

Could you please let us know if there is a chance the programme can be made available until September 2021?

https://us.edstem.org/courses/2345/discussion/188557,post,My results to the optional Assignment Week 9 (Reinforcement Learning),Lectures,DQ1,1,False,2020-12-03T11:05:46.728241+11:00,"Greetings!

I finished my program for the Optional Assignment of Week 9 about Reinforcement Learning and I want to share my results and insights.

This was a really interesting side-project and I'm glad I tried it. By doing it I was able to understand better the reinforcement learning lectures and now I'm more interested in this topic of AI.

The policy iteration and value iteration algorithms were kind off easy to code, but the QLearning one was more challenging, because I had to adapt the code to serve as a simulation without explicitly giving any information of the probability of transition to an specific state or the structure of transitions.

You can check out my code here: https://github.com/Carlitos5336/ReinforcementLearning

These are my answers to the questions from the assignment:

Question 1

We used the policy iteration method to find optimal policy for discount factor 0.1. Try using this method with a different discount factor, for example a much larger discount factor like 0.9 or 0.99, or a much smaller one like 0.01. Does the optimal policy change?

These are my results with different values of lambda:

The greater the lambda, the more the policy values the future rewards, so it prefers to keep a safe strategy by always choosing the Slow Action.

In contrast, when the lambda is close to zero, the policy values more the nearer rewards, so it prefers to take the Fast Action in the Moving State.

Question 2

Now, try using the value iteration method instead. How does the number of iterations change? What about the complexity of implementing each iteration?

These are the number of iteration my algorithm takes for each method using lambda = 0.1.

In fact, the number of iterations using value iteration method is higher than the ones using policy iteration method as proffesor Shipra Agrawal said in one of the lectures.

In terms of complexity,  the most important difference between the two is that in policy iteration method the algorithm calculates the VPI (value function pi) for each iteration, and to calculate the VPI we need to find the inverse of the following matrix:

$$I-\lambda P_{\pi}$$

That is based on the bellman equations for MDPs.

$$v_{\pi}=\left(I-\lambda P_{\pi}\right)^{-1}\cdot r_{\pi}$$

So this operation of calculating the inverse adds a lot of complexity to the algorithm specially because it will repeat several times. In a system with hundreds and thousands of states and transitions, to calculate the inverse of the matrix would be too time consuming. That's why in terms of the number of states and transitions, the policy iteration method is more complex than the value iteration method.

Question 3

Write a python script to implement the Q-learning method (without exploration) for this simple MDP. Run this script several times. Does the algorithm always converge? Now, try adding a simple epsilon greedy exploration and rerun. 

I tested the epsilon-greedy exploration case with an epsilon value of 10%

When using the QLearning method alone just with a greedy exploration by using the action that maximizes the q-value it rarely converges to the same answer in terms of q-values, but it yields almost always the same policy. In the case of the one with epsilon -greedy exploration, the q-values converges almost always and sometimes gets the best policy we found with the other method.

For example, in this case, it yielded a different and better value.

Question 4

Pick your favorite single player computer game, for example, Cart-pole balancing. How would you model the problem of learning to play this game (without needing to know the physics of the game) as a reinforcement learning problem? Define the state space, action space, transition model, reward function and goal of the underlying MDP.

One of the games in wich I'd like to develop an AI using Reinforcement Learning is Tetris.

The goal for the AI would be to fill each cell of the different rows with the different random pieces completely without leaving holes, so the pieces never get to the top of the board.

For every time step of the game, the action space would be [do nothing, move left, move right, rotate]

The state space would be the set of all possible combinations of filled and non-filled cells of the board.

The transition model will be based on the position of filled and non-filled cells that produces an action from a state.

The positive reward could be relative to the amount of filled cells in a row, and negative reward for the amount of holes in the board.

while working on this project I also noticed that the Q-Learning alg as presented in the lectures does not converge for the given MDP. In https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning and https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~arielpro/15780/lec/VelosoRLGradAI2012.pdf (last slide) I found out that the problem lies in the non-deterministic nature of the ""fallen, standing, moving"" MDP. Adding an alpha learning rate as the weighted sum of past QValues does the job (of course after sufficient iterations). 

The Q-Leaning algorithm presented in the lectures only converges in deterministic environments (actions always lead to the same rewards) and has therefore a learning rate alpha of 1. This means that the QValues are fully determined by the current reward and the max(QValue) of the new state, completely ignoring past rewards after taking the same action. 

Thanks for your post and I hope this is interesting for you as well.

In fact, that's the exact problem I saw in the Q-Learning algorithm presented in lecture, it just only seemed to care about inmediate rewards even with some reasonable values of lambda. 

I searched the formula you shared on the slide. Thanks for sharing!

It seems that to calculate these expected values we would have to count the frequencies of getting to a state to infer the probabilities of each transition.

Thanks for your comment, it was really insightful and cleared my doubt!

These courses must be completed before applying to the MS and can be taken at a university and must be issued on a transcript. MOOCs and work experience do not waive this requirement.

A minimum undergraduate cumulative GPA of 3.3 (around a B+, 87-89% average)

Three letters of recommendation, preferably two should be from professors if you graduated fewer than five years ago from your undergraduate or graduate degree program

GRE General Test scores (optional for Spring, Summer, and Fall 2021)

A resume/cv

A personal/professional statement

Tips to strengthen your application:

For those who do not have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science - Again, you must complete the four CS courses and two math prerequisites prior to applying. Aim for at least a B+ in each course. You can take any CS course offered, but here are a few examples of typical CS courses: Intro to Computer Science (COMS W1004 or COMS W1007), Advanced Programming (COMS W3157), Data Structures and Algorithms (COMS W3134 or W3137), which is a prerequisite for most of our graduate-level courses, or/and Discrete Math (COMS W3203). These courses are not offered at CVN so I suggest that you take them at your local community college or four-year university. 

Consider taking the GRE General Test - While the GRE General Test is completely optional for the Spring 2021, Summer 2021, and Fall 2021 terms, doing well on the exam, (i.e., scoring at least a160/170 on the Quantitative section, 158/170 on the Verbal section and 4.5/6.0 on the AWA) can demonstrate your ability to handle a strongly quantitative program. Give yourself about two months to prepare for the exam. 

Enroll in a non-degree course at CVN, no more than 2 - Non-degree courses are essentially the same courses you would take if admitted to the MS program without having to enroll in a degree program. Nearly all of the courses offered can be taken on a non-degree basis, you simply have to meet the prerequisites of the course. Most students choose to take one or two of the core courses listed under the Courses tab. To learn which of these courses will be offered next term, the Spring 2021 course list is now available. The prerequisites can be found in the course descriptions. The credits from these courses, up to six credits(or two courses), can be applied to one of our degree programs. Aim for at least a B+ in these courses and develop a relationship with the professor so that you can request a letter of recommendation when you have completed them. Please note that taking a non degree course does not guarantee admission to the MS program. Since these are the same courses you would take if admitted to the MS, the tuition is the same, about $6,983 per course. To apply, submit a non-degree application via this link. 

Secure strong letters of recommendation, preferably at least two from current or former professors - Think critically about the skills that translate to success in a graduate engineering degree program and find appropriate recommenders who can testify to your ability in these areas: leadership, quantitative, analytical, and English writing/speaking skills, ability to work on a team and independently..etc. 

Explain gaps and/or red flags in your personal statement - Performed poorly your first semester of college? Worked three jobs during your differential equations course? Experienced some personal tragedy that impacted your work/academic performance? Paint a picture for the Admissions Committee about what happened and how you overcame it to assure the Committee that the issue was addressed, and, more importantly, will no longer be a concern if admitted to the program. 

Comprehensive resume/CV - Highlight not only jobs relevant to your intended field of study, but also unrelated positions that have taught you transferable skills (leadership, quantitative, analytical, and English writing/speaking skills, ability to work on a team and independently..etc) that will lead to success in an engineering program. Be sure to include published research, volunteer positions, leadership roles in student or professional organizations, internships, and of course, paid positions.

Please note that CVN Admissions cannot provide guidance on edX/MicroMasters-related matters (upcoming courses, refunds, certificates..etc).

Upon looking at the illustration of the graph presented, I was wondering if dead-ends and turn-about in mazes could be represented as local maximums (or local minimums) and shoulders, respectively.  Perhaps, too, that the exit from a maze could be represented as the global maximum.

This was just a notion I got from the lecture.

Thanks,

CSPs are an example of optimization problems. Here the path from the source to the target is often known and the task is to optimize it. You usually have a cost function for that path, and the algorithms aim to minimize/ maximize that cost. For example, in the map coloring problem, a solution is assigning random colors to all the territories and a cost can be the number of neighboring territories that have the same color. The task of the algorithm would then be to minimize that cost.

You can retrofit a maze search problem to be solved by hill climbing - take some random path and then attempt to lower the cost of parts of it until the overall cost is minimum. There are however better suited algorithms like A-star to achieve this in a much more efficient way. ",p_george,,Mori_Benjamin,,2345/discussion/192062

I have implemented my perceptron classifier and have plotted it until convergence via matplotlib and this is the decision boundary I am getting. As can be seen all of the  points are correctly classified by the boundary. I have also tried different learning rates and number of epochs to try and optimize the line as much as possible. 

The weights used to plot this line are from my Vocareum output. Below is an example of my output1.csv. Am I making some glaring mistake in the format of this file (the last 2 show convergence)?

Open notes. Students can use physical notes or digital notes with program like Adobe Reader or Preview to access the file.

Hi Maria,

It seems your attempt at the onboarding failed. You should be able to see the onboarding practice exam (some quiz questions about Columbia University). Please follow the onboarding instructions and do it again.

Also, please note that the onboarding is an one-attempt process. However, in order to allow your profile to go through, we reset your attempt this time. Please make your you understand the process and resolve previous problems before you try again. If you are not sure, we highly recommend that you contact proctortrack via live chat.

Thanks for responding, 

I had done the ID verification long ago, almost a month back. I believe to have been given the green light since my account name “Makho Mkhize” is a short version of my full name “Makhosonke Mkhize”, which is on my ID. But now I need to change my account name to “Makhosonke Mkhize”. I can’t manually change it because another company is administering the account, and they are on holiday.

I have already done the final exam, yesterday. I will log a ticket as you suggested and provide feedback accordingly. :)

In questions with ""KB entails a statement""  like below

$$KB\models \alpha$$

where alpha is a statement. My understanding is that we need to show that

$$KB \rightarrow \alpha$$

is valid.

Or as the lecture describes we show that 

$$KB \wedge \neg \alpha$$

is unsatisfiable.  Does this mean that we have to show that the above statement is never a tautology?

Now that quiz deadlines are over, could you potentially walk through the following problem?

If KB is defined as follows:

$$KB = \{P \vee Q \vee R, \neg P \vee R, \neg Q \}$$

does 

$$KB\models R?$$

Is the expression in question (R here) also true in all those rows? If yes, then KB⊨R. If R is false in even one of them, then the entailment does not happen.

I remember those Star Trek episodes where the Enterprise received updates with biological elements for improved processing.

In a way, our minds are programmable, by our parents, society, and other external agents. After brain injuries, internal changes and updates can recover lost functions.

I also remember that New Generation episode where Data is judged, Starfleet wanted to disassembly him to study his unique positronic brain, so he defended himself and demonstrated he is a life form, self-aware of his existence. To me, that looks like Dr. Soong created a new form of life. Then, what if we are the creation of some sort of superior beings?

Pure speculations and fantasy on my side, but who knows? ... Similarly, can we be sure we are not living in a simulation? :)

Life is so mysterious! Yet, here we are trying to maximize our own objective functions.

I completed my final exam this afternoon (6hrs ago). The final grade showed up in the progress tab as soon as I completed the exam, followed by the e-mail about proctoring content is under review. 

I just wanted to point out that during the final exam, there was a pop-up when I opened Adobe PDF Reader to view the course handouts. The pop-up said something along the lines of the it not being listed in the permitted Applications. I am assuming this is a warning from the Proctor track Software? I wasn't sure what was going on, so I did open 'Finder' to see system privacy to see if this was a MaC OS thing. 

Anyway, just wanted to point out here and see if anyone else saw such pop-up during their final? Otherwise, I am a bit concerned on what the cause was and hopefully it doesn't violate Proctor track requirements.

You should receive the edX support reply soon but there is no way to expedite the process. I am willing to work with you to let you take the final exam since you have a good academic standing. 

However, please note that this is an exception and it is your responsibility to fulfill the requirements and get ready to take the final proctored exams for any future courses.

The course will be closing in 2 hours but you can still access this discussion forum. When the ID verification is approved, you can reach us on the forum. I will open the exam up for 6 hours for you to take it. 

Please keep me posted.

Got my id verification approved just now. Is there a more direct channel of communication we can use to coordinate the next steps? If I can take it in the next 2h that would be great (11am-1pm EST). After that time, I'll then be away from an environment adequate for proctoring (i'll be in transit between airports). But tomorrow or Monday i'll be settled somewhere I can take it. Im just worried about coordinating the time and date so that I don't miss that 6h time window that the exam will be open.

We have escalated your case to edX support, but, getting ready to take the final exam is a learner's responsibility. Please let us know how it goes.

The lectures were excellent - they were easy to follow and made the content very manageable even though the concepts themselves were not trivial. I'm so glad I discovered this course, it has been a pleasurable learning experience.

Like many others, I'm disappointed that the micro-masters program will not be continuing, but if there is any chance it may be revived in the future, I hope this comment and others like it would help to let everyone at Columbia know that this course is appreciated and valued and we are sad to see it go.
