We will use Ed for course discussion this semester.

If you have any course related questions, you can reach out to your cohorts and course staff here. To help you have a successful experience in learning, we strongly encourage you actively participating in the discussion forum. You can ask questions, read and reply others' posts to benefit your learning. Before you start, we have a few tips for you:



Ask questions that everyone can benefit from.

Answer any question you feel confident answering.

Share interesting course-related content with staff and your peers.

Announcements may also be made on Ed Discussion so make sure you regularly keep your eye out for those. You will also be notified via email for important announcements.

For more information on Ed Discussion, please refer to the Quick Start Guide.

Many thanks

The discussion forums are a way for you to share your thoughts about course material, learn from your fellow students, get to know them better, and report problems.
If you have an urgent matter -- such as needing to report a video or other course component that isn't working properly -- you can get the attention of course staff by creating a new post and putting [STAFF] in the title.
 
There are a few other ways you can participate:
 
Select the ""heart"" icon to like  posts and good responses (so the post will move closer to the top of the discussion thread)
 
Select the “star” icon to follow posts for updates
 
Use “watch” to be notified of all activities in the thread
 
You are part of a diverse learning community that forms the heart of a meaningful learning experience. Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:
Be respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.
Be constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.
 
Be sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.
 
Post appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.
 
Users that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.
 
Please help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.
 
In addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!

FORUM POSTING GUIDELINES

What makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:
 
Read before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.
 
Use informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.
 
Make it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.
 
Stay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.
 
Help keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff. 
 
Thanks for keeping the conversation lively and respectful!",Susan,admin,xc2496@tc.columbia.edu,,,,BAMM101,101/discussion/1098,audit,

I was thinking to finish two of the four courses from the Micromasters program before the December. My plan was to finish one course, take the final exam and move to the next course. However, it looks like the final exam dates are allocated for the last week of this course.  

My question is if a verified learner finishes the lecture materials before December, can they be able to take the final exam before the last week?

I totally understand there are some benefits of taking the exam right when you're done with lectures.

The requirement of this assignment is to write a function that applies to ALL the cases, not just one test case. 

Therefore, yes, you need to automate your process.

First of all many thanks for your prompt answer. 

Unfortunately I'm not being able to get any score even if I'm 100% sure the SQL code works as expected and it's simple. I've used triple quotes for multi line and separated SQL statements with a semi colon (eg: when creating tables) in order to return one single string from the function. Not even Q3 works which is the most simple query.

What else should I do?

Reading the details about the program at https://cvn.columbia.edu/content/micromasters-program-business-analytics, there is a statement saying:



""Is there a timeline for completing all courses in the MicroMasters program?

""Yes, all courses in the MicroMasters program must be completed within 2 years of the start date of the first course in order to apply MicroMasters program credits towards a Columbia degree.""



I noticed that I was enrolled in this course in 2017, but I never started it. Does the start date count since 2017 or since the real start now in 2019?



Does this timeline apply only towards using the credit for a full master at Colombia, but not to this MicroMaster?

I think there is an issue with your grader.

I don't get the points for Status, Length,... though I get full points for other questions.

When investigating Status:

- there are 6 Statuses in the file: ""Open"", ""Close""...

- the most common filtering of the rows would reduce to 5 Statuses (removing ""Email Sent"")

- Still I did two versions for my reply: one version where I return 5 Statuses, one version where I change it to return the full 6 Statuses. In both cases I don't get the mark for the Status test.

Therefore I suspect there is something wrong with your grader, that impacts some other questions as well.

Could you please review.

NB: your exercise is kind of short of explanations about what is clearly expected from the grader, and it seems we have to do a lot of 2nd guessing. It is far from obvious which rows are expected to be removed (for example, it seems you don't want us to remove all the rows with any NA's.

You can use any method to remove punctuations, as long as your function correctly returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each word in the text with the last punctuation removed.

Two examples that we provided in the assignment notebook:

I have completed the assignment and found it straightforward in returning a dictionary with the frequency of each word. My function also converts all words to lower case too.



The issue I am having is in removing punctuation that occurs at the end of the word.

That TypeError is saying that you are calling the isalpha() function with a passed argument (the ""1 given"" part), when it accepts none. This means it should be called without anything within the parathesis.

For the punctuation question, I think you are on the right track but I suggest you read the question and examples more carefully.

I have got to the point now that I use the word.isalpha() in an if statement, I can identify which words have all alphabetical characters. But for those that don't I can only delete the whole word, not just the last character, meaning that the whole word which has a non-alphanumeric character is not added to the dictionary.

index the string to check for a specific character, for example, x[-1] refers to the last character of a word 

slice the string to remove a specific character, for example, x[:-1] removes the last character of a word

String essentially works like a list (of characters) in Python, so I recommend you to review the contents in Week 1.2 Python Strings if you are still not sure how it works since string manipulation is a very important technique in Python.

For all the quizzes I am doing, I noticed that when I choose the correct answer at the first attempt and click on send, the button send remains blue (and allows me to click it) but the attempts used change from 0 to 1.
Later, once I click on the button send once again, the button becomes gray (unavailable) and the message shows that I used 2 attempts out of 2, when in reality I used 1.

Is this behaviour expected or it's sort of a bug? Is there any impact on the grading due to this?

The printouts from the test cases will help you debug which part of your function is failing. In this case, ""(john's"" is what the test cases caught.

There was so much scattered material in 3 & 4 that it seemed incredibly rushed and haphazard.

While I have enjoyed the professor and lectures up until this point, I found this section incredibly frustrating as it was not focused and well organized for someone that is not an intermediate or above python programmer. Perhaps it would be easier to comprehend in person, rather than online as a TA could show more similar examples and correct errors as they became apparent.

If the remainder of the class crams so much info without establishing a more cohesive building block methodology to complete the assignment, I will likely drop the class (after wasting $300) and look for others that are better organized. 

While I was initially excited about the range of topics for this class, I'm wondering if it is skimming/cramming too much and presuming the student has a strong coding background already. I think there could be a full class (6-8 weeks) covering web scraping alone. I'm sure next week I'll say the same about databases. 



The following seems a little misleading at this point...

Simple step-by-step examples to get the basics is important before combining it with other complicated nuances (json, dictionaries, internal vocareum nuances, etc.) would be helpful. Otherwise it produces a lot of frustration. I find myself going to other books and websites to get a general understanding of webscraping - which defeats the purpose of have a self-contained class.

Gradually print out pieces of the HTML until you figure out what types of selectors to use to move through the data to find what you want. 

For example if you want a specific value in an HTML table, first find and print out the table contents, then print .children of the table, then loop through the table rows to see how the page is structured.

One thing that I think is missing from this course is a basic explanation of how the DOM works. That is essential for understanding web scraping, as you're basically moving up and down in the DOM and trying to find relevant pieces of HTML.

I am getting completely stuck on the concept of ""clicking"" and retrieving data once I have scrapped all of the sector hrefs from the sector performance page. 

For example, I can get a list of urls for each of the sectors and then I try to loop thru to get information from the respective pages but nothing happens. Because I don't have any web scraping experience or context, I have tried turning it into a clickable link by adding https://proxy.vocareum.com before hand. That doesn't work either.

/eresearch/markets_sectors/sectors/sectors_in_market.jhtml?tab=learn&sector=50

https://proxy.vocareum.com/eresearch/markets_sectors/sectors/sectors_in_market.jhtml?tab=learn&sector=50

I then try to loop thru the href lists...

 new_url = link.find_all('th', scope=""row"").get_text()
        for link2 in new_url:

            url_set2.append(link2.get('href'))

and get the following error:

AttributeError: ResultSet object has no attribute 'get_text'. You're probably treating a list of items like a single item. Did you call find_all() when you meant to call find()?


In a non-MOOC class it would be very easy to see someone and get general guidance, but in this setting it is very challenging, particularly as I'm not sure if I'm making additional mistakes using the vocareum htms versus regular website scraping. 

I don't want, or expect anyone to give me the answer, but I'm missing key links and getting disenchanted with this particular course. I have taken several other python classes on edX and Coursera (Mich, Berkeley, etc.) and haven't ever experienced this level of frustration before.",Seekingclarity123,,brettslattery123@gmail.com,Rachel_gould,,rachel@rachelgould.dev,BAMM101,101/discussion/3046,verified,verified

I would like to share my takeaways from the Week 4. 

For me this was a very challenging topic, I have worked before with BeautifoulSoup and Selenium, with websites that were straightforward to scrape, but this assignment required me to work out my mind and helped me to understand much better the way we should look at HTML.

This time, in the assignment, the given strings contain multiples nested tags. My only advice (I see this is a difficult assignment for many) is: this particular exercise is not much different than what is done during the Epicurious example, and the shared ipython notebook defines very well the logic to follow for scraping, but it was definitely helpful for me to look at previous weeks topics, especially strings in python.

Your objective when iterating over the sentence is to get each word in each iteration. When you write for x in sentence.lower(), it means you get each character in each iteration. You may want to try the split() function for this homework.

Thanks for your reply. I still have problems with it.

The reason why I wanted to use sentence.lower() is to get the whole sentence in a lower case at first in addition to removing punctuation. I intended to use the split() function later after lowering case & removing punctuation.

However, I reversed the order again & started with split() but without progress.

The problem is in either case (split or lower), I could not know what my problem is when I run my code on pythontutor.com to debug it, the code completely stops.

There are many people like you, who are totally new to programming. However, as long as you follow the videos, you shall be able to do the assignments.

I'm completely new to Python. This assignment while really challenging I found it enriching. 

I spent over 24 hours trying to figure it out, for me it was like a puzzle. I went over the lectures at least 3 three times, searched the web (stack overflow is really helpful). Nevertheless, every time I thought I was getting somewhere, a new issue arose. I would like to share with you what I faced and how I tackled it, perhaps it can help you. 

Got stuck with the tags. I struggled a great deal with this part. After finding what I was looking for, I was not able to remove the tags. Remember the properties of lists and dictionaries. You have to narrow down your search and iterate (this was the key), printing each step helped a ton this way I could see where I was erring and figure out how to fix it.

Since we need to open the files of each item, the lectures are really helpful at this point, try to replicate and scale what the professor does in the epicurious example. 

Whenever you are in a loop think in terms of what you want to iterate (I got lost) printing tells you if you are in the right path or iterated more than required.

Finally my new favorite term is nested dictionaries. If you have every piece of the dictionary and just have to ""merge"" it, google it and pay attention to your indentation . 

Hope it helps.

I spent a couple of days debugging, and I couldn't figure out why the HTML structure from the specific sectors wasn't finding the tags and class names I was looking for. After many thorough reviews of the code and writing things out I recognized I used the wrong variable name in a function instead of the passed argument name. So the argument was never used and gave incorrect page to parse. 

This required a lot of patience, trial and error, reviewing the lectures, reading outside material, testing smaller chunks of codes and building from there. It turned out to be a whole ordeal, which I'm glad I was able to complete.

I think that's what the regular process is for ""programming"", which it was cool to go through it.

Overall the subject was new to me, I enjoyed learning about webscraping and how much simpler it is by having libraries available like BeautifulSoup.

You only need to return the SQL code string in the function. So your code will be something like this:

def create_tables_sql() -> str:

    """"""

It's great that you think about using pymysql. However, this is not necessary for this assignment.

NoSQL databases are getting more and more popular, with MongoDB or DynamoDB among others. But the truth is that relational databases are still widely used, and the scope of python accesing their data through Workbench is really powerful. Small programs can be done to automatize daily extractions from database and conversion to csv, excel...

The topic was well covered and then it's up to us if we improve our MySQL knowledge to work with it. One thing though, not all queries that work in Workbench will work using pymysql, I would rather test them first in a Jupyter Notebook to see what outcome they return.

I looked at your submissions and have a few comments:

1. Our apologies. The auto-grader outputs (e.g. ""Word distribution. OK. 10/10 points"") are there by default, but you need to look at your submission report after you submit the assignments to see your actual points.

2. The first reason you didn't get any points is because your function didn't return anything, you simply printed them out. As an illustration, you can do:

word_dict = word_distribution(""Monica is coming to the city tomorrow!"")
print(word_dict)


and see that the output is ""None"". 

3. You can instantiate a blank dictionary and use a for loop as you already did to add elements to the dictionary, and then return it like this:

def word_distribution(s):
    word_dict = dict()
    <Your code>
    return word_dict

- the teaser lines are different between the notebook and the assignment page so I was trying to achieve a result that isn’t what the assignment is being scored for (hence the use of plaincorpusreader

Please kindly help with my assignment 2. 

I have 10/10 for word distribution but 0/10 for punctuation. 

I checked requests and still have no idea why the system gives me 0 points! Please give me a guide on what I overlooked, because I really do not understand. 

I also don't understand what is calculating punctuation mean? Do I need to calculate how many punctuations in each sentence? Please kindly help, I am extremely confused right now.

I tried to convert the file into a string so that I can know the roots of the page as I thought that because of using a file instead of a real url where I will not be able to ""Inspect"" the page to get the required tags.

I started by the code given in the assignment as follows:

with open('Sector+Performance.htm') as f:
    file1 = f.readlines()
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
BeautifulSoup("""".join(file1),""lxml"")


Then I tried to convert the file into string as follows:

results_page = str(BeautifulSoup("""".join(file1),""lxml""))


Then I tried to get the roots for it as follows:

from lxml import etree
root = etree.XML(results_page)

Please note that BeautifulSoupis an object and there's no way to convert it into a string like str(BeautifulSoup(...)). Instead, you want to parse the string into BeautifulSoup and use its internal functions to find elements. 

For example,

soup = BeautifulSoup(text, 'lxml')

Thank you for your response, it was very insightful!

Regarding my purpose for taking the MicroMasters, I have always wanted to learn Python but unfortunately never had the chance to.  I thought that this specific program would not only provide me with the opportunity to learn Python, but also to learn and practice its very practical uses for business analytics. I am just now getting into the workforce, and, although I am not sure I will be going into business analytics specifically , I believe the courses will equip me with the knowledge and set of skills to apply these programs/concepts into other types of analytics. Well, I certainly hope it does--but I am getting this impression so far :)

Regarding the timeline, I would very much like to take all the courses within one year--but this is due to personal goals rather than time constraints. However, I see that the sessions for the 4 courses have gaps of a couple of months between them. Maybe it is because, at this time, each course only has two sessions available for sign up. 

Since I have never learned Python, I thought it would be most beneficial for me to take this course by itself first. This way, I can actually learn the workings of Python before I delve into the many many things we will do with it in the later courses. Basically, I wanted to take this course prior to starting the others so that I can take the most out of each one. As for the other ones, although I will certainly be learning new things, it will be a less steep learning curve, as I am quite familiar with statistics, supply/demand, models, and other analytical frameworks. So, I guess maybe I could take two courses at once when I take the other courses. My only concern is that, by that time I start the next courses I will be working (well, I certainly hope), and will consequently not have as much time to focus on the courses.

Do you have any information regarding the timing of the other course sessions that will be released soon? Or, if I would definitely need to complete two courses at once in order to complete the entire program within one year?

I know I shared a lot, but I wanted to give you the full picture of my situation, so you may assess it and give me any advice, insight, or feedback that you may have!

Have you signed up for all of the classes (the whole MicroMasters Program), or simply to this course? I don't actually know if the latter is an option, but in case it is, that might be the issue.

In my case, I signed up for all of the courses at once by signing up for the full MM. So, when I click on my dashboard, I see all 4 courses. Under each course, there is a drop down option under the text ""To access the course, select a session."" In this drop down, I see the options ""September 14, 2019 - December 16, 2019"", ""February 9, 2020 - May 10, 2020"", and ""More sessions coming soon"". I see these same options for all 4 courses, and for each of them you can pick one of the two.

However, as I raised as a concern in my last reply, these are the only two options that I see available to pick for now. But I expect/hope they will come up with new sessions soon so we are able to sort this out!

I know it's frustrating to try to plan out the year and not being able to...

In any case, if anything changes on my end, I will certainly let you know :)

I'm not sure if this helps, but it's all I know for now...

the values are not based on the recent data, as shown in the function argument, it reads in a file, not a website. Because the values on the websites change all the time, we decide to use a static file so everyone should have the same output.  Therefore, your first three output should be exactly the same as the example shown.

In your case,

throws a NoneType error because <object> is of type NoneType. This means the function that you think is generating <object>, is actually returning nothing.



For example, this will throw the same error, because foo doesn't return anything, hence 'returns' NoneType.

Also, if you need financial support, you can also apply for financial aids through edX. About your concern for not able to complete the course, you will have to pay again in order to enroll in the verified track in the next run. Since we are entering in Week 5, you still have 7 weeks to complete the course materials. I wonder what is your prior education and if you have any experience with python or any coding language.

In the instructions of week 4 assignment, the following code is written to be used:

with open('Sector+Performance.htm') as f:
    file1 = f.readlines()
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
BeautifulSoup("""".join(file1), ""lxml"")


I need to ensure that I understand it well.

What I understood from it is that as we are not going to scrap the real website because it is changing in real time, we will use the files attached with the assignment. That is why we used in the above code with open file in addition to not using import requests as we are not going to send requests to a real website.

Am I right with this understanding?

What I could not understand is the last line of the above code BeautifulSoup("""".join(file1), ""lxml"")

I did not get what is """" and what is join(file)

Could anyone please confirm my first understanding above and explain the other one to me.

yes, your understanding for reading in a file is correct.

Thanks for your answer. I checked the join() method and understood it. However, I am wondering why we use it in the ""Sector Performance"" file. From my understanding its use will come when we need to concatenate ""each sector fundamentals"" in the final dictionary, so that we can insert each sector's fundamentals within the sector name that is stated in the ""Sector performance"" file as it contains a comprehensive list of all sectors.

Could you please explain this more for me.

Also, I think there are a lot of steps that should be done, but I am struggling to know the first step.

first, try read in the file and see the output, it's actually a list of strings. We use join() to combine them into a large string. The best way to learn how each function works is to run it step by step. Here, you might want to run read in the file and join() function in different cells, then you will see the difference and why we want to do that.

For this assignment, you can find some hints from other students' post in KeyTakeaways sections.

Thanks for reaching out about your question. I have read your code - the first two questions are working correctly as you can already see from your printout. What caused the auto-grader to stop working thus comes from the third question. 

First thing I have noticed that you did not return res. Instead, you used print(res). I believe this is the main reason for the runtime error. However, you need to investigate further to make sure your code is correct.

I managed to run my code and satisfied the instructions

""1. Read the file 311_data.csv provided to you in the StarterCode section of your workbench and store the data in a dataframe.

2. Create a  dataframe containing the columns: 'Created Date','Closed Date','Borough','Descriptor','Complaint Type', 'Agency', 'Longitude', 'Latitude', 'Status'

3. Add the column ‘processing_time’  (in days) to this dataframe.  

4. Create a new column - 'start_time_window' - that contains the hour of the day that the incident report was created

5. output a csv file named output1.csv containing the dataframe, the column should be in the order of 'Created Date','Closed Date','Borough','Descriptor','Complaint Type', 'Agency', 'Longitude', 'Latitude', 'Status','processing_time', 'start_time_window'.  (hint: use df.to_csv('output1.csv') to output the csv)""

My grade is just half and upon looking at the Grading Details, i have 

""AssertionError: Length of output. NOT PASSED. 0/10 points"" .

Also true for the number of unique boroughs, complaint types, statuses etc.

Did I miss any other instructions for the other columns?

I saw that the table illustration  show an 'Unspecified' value on the Borough hence its not necessary to delete it.

My first issue was the NaNs in the date columns which didn’t allow me to find the processing_time. I tried to delete the rows that have NaNs for date but it seems that this is not the right way to deal with it. After a suggestion from another learner, I tried to use the current datetime for those NaNs (assuming that the cases are still open which to be honest it is not a reasonable way to deal with it since the Created day of the cases are during 2016, but it might be a better solution than deleting the NaNs). 

Using the current datetime to fill the NaNs I have no longer the error of length output because, I assume, it doesn’t miss the processing_time data because of the NaNs

My current issue is that even I did all the required steps of the assignment, I still get zero points for ""Time windows 0""  and ""Time windows 5”.

The queries you wrote are supposed to be correct. However, the way you passed it inside the function is what caused the problem. Here's an example of a query with the correct format. 

def get_sql() -> str:

         SELECT *

Please observe the difference between the example and your submission. Notice that, you are passing the query as a string. But in your case return """", you are returning an empty string, so your actual queries would not be executed since they were not returned in the first place.

We have spotted some problems in the answers of Question 2, and we updated the question as ungraded so that your scores would not be affected. In the meantime, we would like to make the following clarifications:

1. .ix[] is deprecated from the Pandas library, and it's replaced by .iloc[], which allows you to access a specific row/rows of data by indexing the dataframe. 

2. When the question asks you to get data from row #2, you should translate it to an index of 1. Therefore, the correct solution would be df.iloc[1].

The order of the dictionary dict() is non-deterministic. However, your answer won't be marked wrong as long as the (key, value) pairs are identical to the solution.

If you really want to make an ordered dictionary, instead you could use OrderedDict(). The order of items would be determined by the order of insertions. You can look up the documentation here in case you're curious.

I still have some trouble understanding where the database museumdbis stored. 

Instead, I would suggest you to use package splite3. For example,

Instead of storing the database on your disk, you could store it in memory temporarily for the sake of this practice.

Please don't post any of your solution code on the forum. It is strictly prohibited. 

To answer your question, you can think of string as a list of characters. VARCHAR(20)simply means a list of 20 characters. This condition restricts the length of your string. You need to explicitly assign a length to your string; otherwise, by default it's VARCHAR(1) in which you're only allowed to store 1 character.

I completed my quiz 1 and for question 1.5, for int divided by int, the answer is integer but my quiz shows it as incorrect and that the correct answer is float.

Can you please explain why since I have learnt that only if one of the variables is float the answer will be of float type.

To clarify your question, it used to be the case in Python 2 that the '/' operator yields an integer if both numbers are integers. However, in Python 3, it's no longer the case as '/' operator does floating point division for both int and float arguments. However, the '//' operator still works the same. 

Hope that helps.

In the video web Data Formats 3.3, character size in Jupiter note book  is so small that nothing is easily readable and is very difficult to take notes and practice.  Is there a way to overcome this difficulty ? In my case even use of magnifying glass does not help.  In fact this is a problem in other videos also .

Unfortunately, the video has already been recorded and the font size of the jupyter notebook inside the video is fixed. However, you could download the notebook and run it yourself while you are going through the lecture.

Thanks for your question. Another way you could launch jupyter notebook more quickly is by using command line in the terminal. 

For example, after you 'cd' into the directory where your notebook is stored, you can simply do

cd /path/to/your/notebook
jupyter notebook your_notebook.ipynb

np.dot(v1,v2)

is just going to return the dot product of two vectors. If the inputs are two 1-D vectors, it's doing the inner product. If they are 2-D matrices, then it's equivalent to a matrix multiplication. 

You can read here for more information about this function. 

If you are not sure how to do matrix multiplications, maybe this tutorial would be helpful to you.

After downloading all the data in nltk, which you have already done as all the bars turned green, you have to exit this download session simply by clicking File -> Exit if you are using a MacBook. 

For your reference, you can check lecture recording 9.1 from 1:42 to 1:45. If you exit successfully, your jupyter notebook will display a printout ""True"". You don't need to drag and drop any external files at this stage.

If you are using Windows computer, when you are downloading, the download session should tell you the location of the data folder. You just need to follow the lecture, try to find the folder and drag and drop those two text files.

Here's some hints for you. For most of the functions in pandas, any time you call a pandas function, it's going to return a new data frame. 

Thus, instead of doing 

df = pd.DataFrame(...)
df1 = df.set_index(...)


you could basically do this in one line 

df = pd.DataFrame(...).set_index(...)

I would like to give you some hints. Please note that this is a multiple answers question. That being said, one or more choices could be right. 

For question one, an empty list basically means that there's no element inside a list whatsoever. if b is an empty list, it should have the property such that b[0] will throw an error since there's nothing inside the list.

Do you have trouble downloading the notebook or you simply can't open it? If it's the latter, you just need to launch the jupyter application in anaconda. After that, you will be directed to a directory, try to find the right directory and find the notebook you want to open.

I also tried:

sectors = results_page.find_all('table')[4].find_all('tr').find_all('th') 

as initially I did not know the name of desired table, so I got the total count of tables in the web page & by eyeballing that the desired table is the last one, so I indexed it as .find_all('table')[4] , here there are a lot of problems as I got the following errors which I do not understand, provided that I need all table rows ('tr') and their cells ('th').

You don't need to include the UNIQUE clause in this assignment (although doing it is not wrong). What happened was that when you ran:

c.executescript(insert_data_sql())
conn.commit()
insert_data_sql()


in your script, the values were inserted into the table. However, in our autograder, we also have these codes as well. Therefore, when the test case ran and tried to insert the same values into the table, the unique constraints were violated. 

In short, I suggest you remove the UNIQUE clause for this assignment.

You will need to back up your data, and download the previous OS version if not already previous to beginning the process.

Please read the guide thoroughly, and make sure you understand each step clearly before starting. I would advice to print out the instructions if you don't have a second device/computer to access the guide. Happy Journey!

Yes, you are right. Assignments do not create new copies. For example, new_list = old_list, here new_list and old_list both refer to the same list. However, copy does create a new list, for example new_list = old_list.copy(), additional memory is taken to generate this copy.

1. Use the print function to ensure your iterations are pulling all relevant values for each sector.

n_url = 'http://ptrckprry.com/course/ssd/data/negative-words.txt'
positive_words = get_words(p_url)
negative_words = get_words(n_url)


The word_list = words.split('\n') part as far as I know will split all the words in the document including the many (;;;;;; at the top of the document and puts each of them in a separate line and will continue with the other actual words that is located between the upper ;;;;;;;; line & the lower ;;;;;;; line (i.e. this will increase the number of words that we already have in the document that starts alphabetically and as such the normal English words will be counted as positive words.

What this does is it builds the list of every line.

The if statement does the following:

if ';' in word or not word:
            word_list.pop(index)




What this does is it checks two conditions:

Firstly:

if ';' in word 

Hence, if in the string there exists a ';' proceed by popping this from the list. Thus, removing it and moving onto the next.

Secondly:

if not word


This is simply a negation of 'word'. What it does is checks if word, which is False if word is  empty (""""). Then negates it with not. Therefore, this proceeds if word is empty by removing empty lines from the list.



For example:

(1) <Code ... Code ... Code>
(2) 
(3) <Code ... Code ... Code>
(4)
(5)
(6) <Code ... Code ... Code>


Lines 2,4, and 5 will be filtered out from the list. ",Michael,admin,mg3856@columbia.edu,Mahmoud_raya,,mahmoudraya@hotmail.com,BAMM101,101/discussion/8716,audit,

By incomplete address, I think the professor meant ambiguous expression of the address. For example, 

1. get_lat_lng(""Columbia University"", api_key)

2. get_lat_lng(""London Business School"", api_key)

Here you might notice, we have 'Columbia University', instead of 'Columbia University, New York, NY'. 

The idea is you don't have the complete address, but you need to figure out the latitude and longitude associated with those incomplete addresses.

There are couple of questions in this assignment:

1. I made several submissions for this assignment. In previous submission, I got the full score for text of page question (20/20) but it was changed to 0 after my recent submission. My code still work just fine, can any of the staff tell me what's wrong with my code?

2. I have spend a lot of hours on question 3 and it seems like either the corpus or dictionary might be wrong, my output produce different output. Can the staff see my code and point me to right direction?

Thank you so much!

I have kind of the same problem, with removing just the last punctuation and of course got graded 0. As you can see I worked with punctuations and excluded some punctuations. This seems not correct. With x.isalpha I can separate the string in two lists, one just with words which are alphabetical and the other list with words with punctuations. No I basically need a loop to check the last character of each word and if the last character is a punctuation it should be removed. But here I am stuck. Can you please check?

For this assignment, you don't really need to do train, test split. Using the full data to train the model is fine as far as this assignment concerns. 

But for real life problems, for sure, you will need to do that. In fact, you not only need to split the whole dataset into train and test dataset, but also split the train dataset further into train and validation dataset for cross-validation. 

Regarding what fraction you need to give for the splitting, I think it depends on the size of your data. If your data is very large, you could give a smaller fraction for your test dataset, and vice versa. Normally, 15% - 20% test data should be sufficient.

1. stopWORDS or stopSTEMS? (the STOPWORD list that is imported is words, not stems)

2. isalpha or isalnum? (the former makes more sense with all the bibliographical references). 

In the lectures he didn't tokenize (but that way one loses all of the words that have punctuation), so tokenization is essential -- right?.

Then there is stemming (but the imports seem to favor inflected forms). 

I've tried all combinations and permutations, and nothing looks like the output you are expecting. My current output is below. Could you kindly look at my code and see if I'm doing something obviously bad?

We noticed that many students are having difficulty with assignment 6, part 3. We consolidated all of these errors and reconfigured the assignment so things work more smoothly. There are two options: First, please change the funciton name from run1() to run(). If that doesn’t work after submission, please download your code onto your local machine and then reset the assignment by going to actions -> reset assignment. Then, repaste your code into the respective cells.

First of all, because you had two return statements, one after another, your function always disregarded the second return statement. 

As a consequence, you never created the curator table, and therefore you couldn't join the two tables. 

I suggest you use only one return statement for each function you try to create.

please follow the instructions carefully,

2. Save the predictions as a CSV called 'predictions.csv'.

You should have two columns, the row number ('index') of the row in the 'topredict.csv' file

1. you need a csv file as output

I checked your answers - please see below my feedback:



For Q6: please see the answer on your previous post.

For Q8: when we designed this quiz question, we have in mind an answer as a pandas Series. Your answer returned a pandas DataFrame. As we didn't specify the return type, I will give you the point for this question.

For Q9: it is best practice not to put a logical value inside quotes. You may be able to run it because pandas understood what you want to do, but it's not the optimal way.

For Q10: if you are to use argument name in a function, every argument should have names (I am referring to something like value). In this problem, we prefer that you don't use argument names.

a = np.arange(12)
b = a
c = a.view()
d = a.copy()

but if we change the first element of c to 2:

c[0] = 2
print(c)
print(b)


will result in:

I think you misunderstand the input (file1) for the fidelity_sector_report() function. file1 is defined in advance by the following lines of codes:

# Run this cell and do not change it
with open('Sector Performance.htm') as f:
    file1 = f.readlines()
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
BeautifulSoup("""".join(file1), ""lxml"")


You should expect outputs like the following for the first 3 sectors when running fidelity_sector_report(file1).

{'results': {'Communication Services': {'enterprise_value': 286.81,
   'return_on_equity': 15.82,
   'dividend_yield': 3.91},

  'Consumer Staples': {'enterprise_value': 164.55,

In your function, the input is a list of sector htm file names. This is not the input that we expected.

I am trying to calculate the processing time. I am using the following for conversion of Created Date and Closed Date. 

df['Created Date'] = df['Created Date'].apply(lambda x:datetime.datetime.strptime(x, '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p'))

Looking at the TypeError, I think your df['Closed Date'] is a float Series. Can it be that you have NaN values somewhere in this column? 

Without knowing what you did before this step, I will not be able to help further. If you have follow up questions, please submit your code on edX so I can take a look at your entire work (you have unlimited attempts at assignments).

You can simply use pd.to_datetime(df['Closed Date']). The NaN values will be converted to NaT. You can read more about the compatibility between NaN and NaT here.

Below is my output for Q1. When I compare my answer to the first 5 lines of my function to the target answer given in the exercise,  it looks identical, but the marker gives me 0 points :(. 

I'm not sure why, I've read the other comments about title etc and I think I am getting the html from the right tags/atributes. 

Here is an excerpt from my code that I use to create the location:



listOfLocations.append((""Philosophers/""+elm[0]+"".html""))

where elm[0] is the list of philosophers' name

It looks fine

Anyway I am going to leave it for now and get on the other questions.

Any clues, tips or help gratefully received

I looked at your code, and here is my feedback:



The definition of start_time_window is ""contains the hour of the day that the incident report was created"". You used closed date for this column. 

You don't need to remove NaN values from Closed Date. In fact, doing so will make you fail several of our test cases.

I have a block with the LSI question. 



I know I have to create a corpus and I know I have the philosopher files that I have use. (from exercise 1)

From then once I have created a corpus,  a document can be produce that will show the relationships between different philosophers. 

My problem is how do I link the philosopher  names to the philosopher description that goes into the corpus?

When I look at the videos, I get confused. For example when looking at community data [54], In the videos  the community data is loaded by the command:

community_data = PlaintextCorpusReader(community_root,community_files)

where:



community_root = ""data/community"". (which I understand is folder location)

community_files = ""community.*"". (which is all the files within the folder)

when the community_data.fileids() 

the output is:



['community.1',
 'community.10',
 'community.11',
 'community.12',
 'community.13',
 'community.14',
 'community.15',
 'community.16',
 'community.17',
 'community.18',
 'community.19',
 'community.2',
 'community.20',
 'community.21',
 'community.3',
 'community.4',
 'community.5',
 'community.6',
 'community.7',
 'community.8',
 'community.9']



How do I get the model to load with Philosophers' names as fileIds.(or I don't need to do that?) I think I am making a silly mistake and missing an obvious step and/or I have totally misunderstood something...

When keeping the LSI outside of my loop, the most similar philosopher listed is always the same philosopher. So, I have tried taking the next-most-similar philosopher, i.e. sims[1][0]. This does not return the answers that the answer key suggests.

My next idea was to try to create a list of docs excluding the philosopher trying to be matched, and then to match that with sims[0][0]. This also doesn't work.

So, how do I get the most similar philosopher excluding the philosopher itself? I feel like there are multiple ways to approach this problem, and I can't figure out which way the answer key wants me to approach this problem.

I spent quite a lot of time solving the third part of the 6. assignment. Unfortunately, my output alters from the suggested solution and I am not able to find the reason for this. Is it possible that you check my code and give me a hint where I am wrong? Receiving 0 points even though I spent so much time and I am so close to the right output feels terrible.

Below my results. Maybe some of my fellow students got the same output and found a solution?

You only need to return the SQL code string in the function. So your code will be something like this:

It's great that you think about using pymysql. However, this is not necessary for this assignment.

Note, as humans we can only visualize space in up to 3 dimensions, and 2 dimensions is much easier. However, incorporating color and shapes, for example, allows us to embed more dimensions without adding more spatial dimensions. 

It is unlikely you will encounter higher dimensional visualizations in the final exam, but it is likely to be good to visualize data in the real world. Specifically in class, we showed two ways to visualize correlations. THe first is below:


Since your question deals with general analysis of graphs, lets use these examples but talk about the general case.This graph above has the different categories below. It analyzes the correlation of some variable, Z, with the different X variables (fixed acidity, citric acid, etc). The y-value is the correlation of ZX. 

Below is an example of another type of visualization we saw.


The correlation graph is drawn from the correlation matrix. X-axis and y-axis are independent  variables and each point represents the correlation between the two variables. For example, in the graph below, there are 60 variables in the data, the graph shows the correlation between all the pairs (60x60, total of 360 points). Different graphs may have different colors, but for the graph below, the yellow one, is very high correlations. Blues shows negative correlations. Interestingly, the correlations along the y = x line are bright yellow (1). Think about why (hint: correlation between (yx) along y = x). The light yellow and light green shows weaker absolute relations.

Graphs are mathematical structures used to model relations between objects.
These are the graphs introduced in the lecture

G = nx.Graph()  # Undirected simple graph
d = nx.DiGraph()  # directed simple graph
m = nx.MultiGraph()  # undirected with parallel edges
h = nx.MultiDiGraph()  # directed with parallel edges


Directed graph is a graph in which edges have orientations, in other words, the flow could only be one way. for example:

Multi graph, in contrast to simple graph is a graph permitted to have multiple edges. It could be either directed or undirected, similar to simple graph. For example, below is a directed multi graph,

In terms of when to use what type of graphs, it depends on what kind of relations between the objects you are modeling. For example, does direction matter? does each node have relations with multiple other nodes? Based on these conditions, you could decide what graphs to use. 

For example, in the case of traveling salesman problems, or distance problems, the distance between two nodes is the only data embedded in each edge. The distance between them does not depend on the direction. So this graph would be undirected. But, say the roads are one-way roads… then of course, direction matters and we would want to make these graphs directed. Every undirected graph can be turned into a directed graph (think about how), so it’s more of a contextual problem. ",Naili Ding,admin,nd2588@columbia.edu,,,,BAMM101,101/discussion/11364,audit,

Here's an article I think would be helpful for you. You can use Q-Q plot to check various things, but one of its main use is to check whether or not a distribution is normal. 

As you can see from the graph above, we can use a normal Q-Q plot to check a sample distribution's normality. It plots the sample distribution against the theoretical normal distribution. In the case above, if the sample distribution is normal, you would expect a straight line. And the more the curve deviates from the straight line, the less confident we are about the normality of the sample distribution.

I would really appreciate some direction. 

I have been working on this assignment for 2 days. For some reason, I am having issues on the get filenames section of the grader. By the autograder, my code creates the list of tuples and includes the name. But the path is empty in the list for some reason. 

When I run it on my own notebook, there are no problems at all, and I get the complete list of tuples including both the names and paths. So I am not sure what exactly the issue is. 

Would someone please take a look at my code and advise me on what exactly I am doing wrong/what may be missing on my code?

** Added Note: it is also a little bit weird, because even though I get an empty list as the output for question 1, I actually get the correct answer for question 3, which is dependent upon the result of question 1. So it is very tough to see what I did wrong, because it seems that I get the correct result, but it is not being displayed in the output for question 1 somehow.

I would truly appreciate if someone could please help me.

Thank you for your questions and please see the answer below:

1. No digital note allowed. If you open a jupyter notebook during the exam, that will cause you to fail the exam and thus, losing the ability to earn the certificate. 

2. If you have an error message, you should reach out to PSI live chat, they can help you inspect the software installation and conduct a system check. 

3. You can not use google translator, opening any other taps on the browser except the edX exam. Otherwise, your exam might be flagged and reported as suspicious behavior. 



If you are nervous about the final exam, make sure you take the practice final exam which helps you better prepare for the finals. 



Good luck!!

I think the easier way is not to use dictionary in this case. Since you already scraped all the philosophers' names, you only need to transform a name into a different format by using string manipulation. 

For example, 

if you want to change 'hello' to 'hello.html', you can simply do f'{a}.html' or a+'.html' where a = 'hello'. You can look up string formatting here. Imagine doing this in a for loop.

I totally agree that dictionary is very handy in data storage, however, if your output is going to have a consistent format anyway, it might be more convenient to manipulate the string on the go. In the example above, (a, a+'.html'). The answer to your question is more or less applying this trick.

So I cannot get pass the psi browser step (input your validation), I contacted their help and they said I had to contact info@edx.org and get a new validation code.

I had to login to edx already anyway) I wasn't expecting the login screen and I don't know the password since it is complex and is held in Safari, I tried several times but couldn't remember the password correctly but I noticed, below the login field there was functionality to use GOOGLE to authenticate (ouath 2) , I clicked on login with Google button but then the PSI browser went all white - the white screen of death, nothing worked in the browser, just a white screen, the back button didn't work, nothing worked  and so I had to close the browser. 

I opened up safari got my password, wrote it down, then tried to start again,  but when I tried to start again it didn't have a  exam code anymore, I went to the edx page, to get the exam code and it had gone, all the page shown me was I could end the exam early and I could see was the timer, counting down and the exam timer had started yet I couldn't see the exam. I had a chat with a PSI browser person and they said I needed a new code and that I had to contact info@edx.org. I sent them a email but they have a 2 day response time. (sigh)

I have asked the staff and edx to help. I am still waiting to hear back. They haven't considered the users experience. I hate to think that I have got this far and couldn't take the final exam and get a good mark. I was really looking forward to taking the exam and finishing the course. 

I'm feeling fed up,

I am exactly on the same boat as you right now,

I did not remember my password and so had to close the browser to reset my password and when I restarted the browser,it shows that I can start the exam but not the exam code which the PSI software requires again after all the ID verification.



Staff, please help. I have already reached out to EDX after the PSI contact person said so.

I am so frustrated with the amount of confusion happening in Edx.

I am very sorry for the trouble you had. I'd really like to help and here are what I noticed a common theme:  

1. Students should use edX account (user name and password) to log in for edX and exam but not other 3rd parties (i.e. Facebook account)

2. Have your password remembered

3. Take the practice proctored exam

4. Watch the video to learn the steps: https://support.edx.org/hc/en-us/articles/360034119314-Proctored-Exam-Quick-Start-Guide

EdX staff will assist you with exam reset and they respond faster than they said in the email (according to other learners' experience). Please let us posted on your status.

Good job for taking the practice proctored exam. There will be no feedback on whether your room passed the room check or not. The purpose of the exam is to check your system compatibility. So if your microphone, camera, and computer can run the proctored software, you are good to go. 

Please make sure you log in with your edX account, remember your account password, and have a steady internet connection. Also, have a clear desk while taking your exam. Remove the non-related stuff from your desk. Remain in front of your screen the whole time while taking the exam (i.e. no leaving the room). 

I suggest you can watch the video: https://support.edx.org/hc/en-us/articles/360034119314-Proctored-Exam-Quick-Start-Guide

- Cache and cookies were deleted previously
- Internet is stable and roughly 15 Mbps for both upload and download

Also team please note that I had surgery last Friday and got released from the hospital on Wednesday with the instructions to rest.

Let me share my experience on the PSI Secure Browser.  As many had encountered, I also got the ""bandwidth"" issue which reason was identified by the Secure Software support.  My resolution was 1) to use more powerful CPU, 2) to use lower resolution display,  and 3) to avoid using a PDF reader.

When I took the practice exam with Dell XPS 13 (screen resolution: 3200x1800), the practice was so smooth, and I did not get any issues.  At that time I did not use any other software (as PSI Secure Browser request the confirmation to kill such software), did not browse any other material including Columbia University webpages.  I thought I have no issue with that testing environment.

I took the final exam on Tuesday in the original final week.  I used the same PC in the same wired network environment (which I later measured upstream at 300Mbps, downstream at 700Mbps).  This time I tried to use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to view my notes and the handouts in digital form.  At the 2nd question I wanted to confirm the answer on the handout, and started to flip pages.  Then I was kicked out of the exam.  I contacted the Secure Software and got to know that the reason of disconnection was insufficient bandwidth, which seems a little weird.

I thought it might be the nature of the PSI Secure Browser, because such software should be used also at real test center typically carrying out closed-book tests.  If so, it needs to detect cheating through running other software.  Although the use PDF reader is allowed in our case, running some other software might be affecting in a bad way.  The browser also reminded me at the booting time that it uploads the image from webcam, and all the activity on the screen is recorded.  So it would make sense to think that the use of PDF reader became a big load for the laptop's CPU to compress such higher resolution screen to upload, and it would be possible that such load resulted and/or was detected as insufficient bandwidth.

Based on that assumption, when I retook the exam, I prepared a box PC with a powerful CPU and more memory.  I connected a full-HD (1920x1080) display instead of one with higher resolution.  I also prepared my notes and the handouts in physical form to avoid the use of the PDF reader.  It was a very good experience to take the proctored exam which went so smooth until the end of the exam.  I really enjoyed the final exam.",Shu-Yi,admin,sh3146@columbia.edu,Shu-Yi,admin,sh3146@columbia.edu,BAMM101,101/discussion/13062,audit,audit

Note that the remaining requirements are met, and I already contacted PSI contact support the 3rd time I tried to take the exam (the other times PSI contact support would never work) > They checked my requirements and they were fine so the only solution that they told me I should use is to open the PSI Secure Browser via right click > Open as administrator. Which I did without much success.

On top of the fact that I never managed to take the exam, I just received an e-mail with the subject ""Proctoring Results For Analytics in Python Final Exam"" stating the below:

I expect to be home by then. I would have available a big living room with books etc... Is that acceptable? Otherwise I could take it tomorrow or Wednesday in the hospital taking into account thag my room has tv, bed, bathroom etc...

What is better to pass the room check?

I already tried also to take the exam as I did not have a response and I experienced technical issues. Loading constantly but never working, I raised it with edx team. 

Also, do I need to give you papers of the surgery? I could deliver via mail for example

Also, I have an update from the doctors and I seem to have reduced mobility for a while due to 10 stitches and bloated belly.

I would like to be able to take the exam in the hospital, which implies scanning the room showing the window that I would use as a desk and showing all available material in the room (my phones, bakcpack, bed, wardrobe etc...)

Would that be possible? Otherwise I don´t think I will be able to meet the conditions set by the exam of a totally closed room with no material on it at all.",Kawasso90,,kawasso90@gmail.com,Shu-Yi,admin,sh3146@columbia.edu,BAMM101,101/discussion/13062,verified,audit

I recently started a new job in a new city (and had an unexpected medical issue) so I was using this weekend to scramble and complete all assignments, quizzes, and the final in order to complete the requirements for the verified track... I somehow missed that the quizzes and homework were due on the 8th and not the 16th with the final... Now I'm reading that there are issues for Catalina users in downloading the proctoring software.

I understand that it is my fault for waiting until the last weekend to start the class, but I am now at a cross roads and don't know if I should continue on and attempt to take the final, or if I should apply for a refund for this course? 

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you for letting us know your concern. Actually, there is no conflict for Catalina users to download the proctor software. The problem was cleared since PSI updated their 4.0 and we have reached out through weekly emails about this. 

If you are not able to do the assignments and you are still in the grace period to get the refund, you should act now. Our course will be open again next February. Let me know what you think.

It is unfortunate that this happened with little time left! When the system exits out, the timer still runs, even though you would have trouble logging in. The best thing for this is continue to contact edX support and ask for an exam reset. The PSI monitoring software is extremely powerful, so any popups that come up can affect the system. The 'simpler' your computer is, the better since there are less background data usages and possible add-ons. For example, a library computer works, but a decked out NVIDIA computer with tons of add-ons will have many overlays appearing overtime in the background, or notifications in general, which the PSI software can flag.",Michael,admin,mg3856@columbia.edu,Carolamez,,carolamez@gmail.com,BAMM101,101/discussion/13104,audit,verified

Due to the complication of the proctoring software, the course staff decided to extend the course due date until December 23rd, 2019, 23:30 UTC to let you take (or retake) the proctored final exam. Before you proceed, please make sure you follow these steps before you take the final exam:



Take the practice proctored exam to verify your system compatibility


Use your edX credential to log-in for the final proctored exam



If you use other 3rd party (i.e. facebook or google account) login, you will not be able to access to the final exam. 


Close all other tabs, communication apps or any add-on software (i.e. Skype or Messenger) to prevent any pop-up message which could result in your exam flagged as violating the proctor exam rules. 


There can be many background data using apps you have installed on personal laptops, or network blocking security systems in corporate computers. Each of these can make PSI flag your exam. Therefore, the simpler the computer used, the better. An option is to log in as a ‘guest’ user on your computers (but then, this depends on if you downloaded PSI under all users or your admin account).

If your exam gets locked out or blocked, note that the timer still runs. When it ends, your exam will be submitted for you. We understand this is an issue, and the best resolution is to contact info@edx.org to reset your exam and report this on the discussion forum. PSI cannot reset exams, but they can determine why you were logged out. 



We are here to assist you if you have any other questions.

Thank you for your reply to my question, and thank you and the team for all the support you have provided me and the learners throughout this course. Although I wish everyone had the same deadline to take finish the course, I do understand your reason I cannot retake.

I do have a different question though: as I have already enrolled in Marketing Analytics, do you have any tips for preparing for STEM-related finals, such as this one? My background is not mainly in STEM, so I think part of the reason there was such a big spread between my course performance and final exam performance was that I did not have a good preparation strategy, other than re-reading my notes and making a summary. Do you have any tips?



Thanks again!

Let me share my experience on the PSI Secure Browser.  As many had encountered, I also got the ""bandwidth"" issue which reason was identified by the Secure Software support.  My resolution was 1) to use more powerful CPU, 2) to use lower resolution display,  and 3) to avoid using a PDF reader.

When I took the practice exam with Dell XPS 13 (screen resolution: 3200x1800), the practice was so smooth, and I did not get any issues.  At that time I did not use any other software (as PSI Secure Browser request the confirmation to kill such software), did not browse any other material including Columbia University webpages.  I thought I have no issue with that testing environment.

I took the final exam on Tuesday in the original final week.  I used the same PC in the same wired network environment (which I later measured upstream at 300Mbps, downstream at 700Mbps).  This time I tried to use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to view my notes and the handouts in digital form.  At the 2nd question I wanted to confirm the answer on the handout, and started to flip pages.  Then I was kicked out of the exam.  I contacted the Secure Software and got to know that the reason of disconnection was insufficient bandwidth, which seems a little weird.

I thought it might be the nature of the PSI Secure Browser, because such software should be used also at real test center typically carrying out closed-book tests.  If so, it needs to detect cheating through running other software.  Although the use PDF reader is allowed in our case, running some other software might be affecting in a bad way.  The browser also reminded me at the booting time that it uploads the image from webcam, and all the activity on the screen is recorded.  So it would make sense to think that the use of PDF reader became a big load for the laptop's CPU to compress such higher resolution screen to upload, and it would be possible that such load resulted and/or was detected as insufficient bandwidth.

Based on that assumption, when I retook the exam, I prepared a box PC with a powerful CPU and more memory.  I connected a full-HD (1920x1080) display instead of one with higher resolution.  I also prepared my notes and the handouts in physical form to avoid the use of the PDF reader.  It was a very good experience to take the proctored exam which went so smooth until the end of the exam.  I really enjoyed the final exam.",Shu-Yi,admin,sh3146@columbia.edu,,,,BAMM101,101/discussion/13205,audit,

The discussion forums are a way for you to share your thoughts about course material, learn from your fellow students, get to know them better, and report problems.
If you have an urgent matter -- such as needing to report a video or other course component that isn't working properly -- you can get the attention of course staff by creating a new post and putting [STAFF] in the title.
 
There are a few other ways you can participate:

You are part of a diverse learning community that forms the heart of a meaningful learning experience. Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:
Be respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.
Be constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.
 
Be sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.
 
Post appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.
 
Users that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.
 
Please help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.
 
In addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!

FORUM POSTING GUIDELINES

What makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:
 
Read before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.
 
Use informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.
 
Make it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.
 
Stay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.
 
Help keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff.

A general example: If $$X_1,X_2,...,X_n$$

are independent random variables with$$X_i\sim N\left(\mu_i,\sigma_{i\ }^2\right)$$

Then we have$$\sum_{i=1}^na_iX_i\sim N\left(\sum_{i=1}^na_i\mu_i,\sum_{i=1}^na_i^2\sigma_i^2\right)$$



A counter example to show the importance about the independence assumption: if we have$$X_1\sim N\left(1,1\right)$$

and$$X_2:=-X_1\sim N\left(-1,1\right)$$

Then$$X_1+X_2\equiv0$$

, which does not follow$$X_1+X_2\sim N\left(1-1,1+1\right)=N\left(0,2\right)$$

, since these two random variables are dependent, actually, perfectly anti-correlated.

I just need a small clarification for Regression Analysis quiz week 4. The question is to find the 95% confidence interval for the variable PROMOTE. Fortunately, my value was closer to the choices given when I used Z-distribution confidence interval values and I got it right. But when I see the solved solution, I could see that it uses t-distribution confidence interval value. The number of observations given is more than 30. Then why there is a need to use t instead of Z ?

The general rule is when the number of samples is small, we should use Student's t-distribution, and when the number of samples is large, we should use z-distribution. The underlying reason is when the number of samples becomes large enough, t-distribution approaches z-distribution.



In your question, although N > 30, the t-distribution should still be precise, so we provide the correct choice by t-distribution. Meanwhile, as you mentioned, your answer is close to the correct choice. This is not coincidence, as t-distribution becomes sufficiently close to z-distribution. In our assignments and exams, we will consider both t-distribution and z-distribution as correct answers when N > 30 unless specifically informed in the problem.



For your information (the technical details here are not required in this course), the main difference is that we do not know the population s.d., so we need to estimate by the s.e. of the sample. That's why t-distribution should be applied when the number of samples is small. You can find more details here.

The sample mean and sample variance does not necessarily equal the population mean and population variance. But the sample mean and sample variance converges to population mean  and population variance when sample size goes to infinity (more technical details see here but not required).

Here is an illustrative case: you only draw two samples from standard normal distribution N(0,1), and these two sample values are a and b (b>=a). Sample mean is $$\frac{b+a}{2}$$

and sample variance is$$\frac{\left(b-a\right)^2}{2}$$

Since a and b are randomly picked, you can have any possible cases of$$-\infty<a\le b<\infty$$

, then the sample variance can vary in $$\left[0,+\infty\right)$$

, so does the sample s.d. Also the sample mean can vary in$$\left(-\infty,+\infty\right)$$",Fred Li,,xl2806@columbia.edu,Vidya M Shankar,,vmshankar30@gmail.com,BAMM102,100/discussion/3466,audit,verified

You std dev in this case should be multiplied by sqrt(n) since there are n i.i.d normal random variables, so you need to calculate ( pop mean * 225 +( z value * std dev of sample * sqrt(225))) in this case.

I think you have misunderstood the handout, here, it says that this correction is wrong instead of unnecessary. It is because in ordinal data, the spacing between the values may not be the same across the levels of the variables.

Say we assign scores 1, 2, 3 and 4 to these four levels of educational experience and we compare the difference in education between categories one and two with the difference in educational experience between categories two and three, or the difference between categories three and four. The difference between categories one and two (elementary and high school) is probably much bigger than the difference between categories two and three (high school and some college).  In this example, we can order the people in level of educational experience but the size of the difference between categories is inconsistent (because the spacing between categories one and two is bigger than categories two and three).  If these categories were equally spaced, then the variable would be an interval variable.

This correction is valid only if the data is interval data.

I have a question with regards to calculating the CI for difference in mean and that of difference in proportions . Why is there a change in the formula as shown below ? 

We calculate the confidence intervals for difference in two means as (X¯ − Y¯ ) ± 1.96 × square root(sX^2/n1  + sY^2/ n2).

The confidence intervals for difference in two proportions is (pˆ1 − pˆ2) ± 1.96 × square root( pˆ1(1 − pˆ1)/ n1 + pˆ2(1 − pˆ2) / n2). 

Here the standard deviation of point estimate for each proportion is p(1-p)/n . Then , going by the same formula as CI for difference in two means shouldn't it be :

 (pˆ1 − pˆ2) ± 1.96 × square root( pˆ1(1 − pˆ1)/ n1/n1+ pˆ2(1 − pˆ2) / n2/n2).",Vidya M Shankar,,vmshankar30@gmail.com,,,,BAMM102,100/discussion/4285,verified,

Generally, you can memorize standard deviation part by $$\sqrt{\sigma_{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}}^2}=\sqrt{\sigma_{\overline{X}}^2+\sigma_{\overline{Y}}^2}$$

For the first case,$$\sigma_{\overline{X}}^2=\frac{s_X^2}{n_1},\ \sigma_{\overline{Y}}^2=\frac{s_Y^2}{n_2}$$

(Keep in mind the bar notation!)

For the second case, $$\sigma_{\overline{X}}^2=\frac{p_1\left(1-p_1\right)}{n_1},\ \sigma_{\overline{Y}}^2=\frac{p_2\left(1-p_2\right)}{n_2}$$

The seemingly contradiction results from $$s_X^2\ne\frac{p\left(1-p\right)}{n}$$

1.The confidence intervals for difference in two proportions is (pˆ1 − pˆ2) ± 1.96 × square root( pˆ1(1 − pˆ1) n1 + pˆ2(1 − pˆ2) n2)

From confidence intervals to p-values

p-value (in %): is 100 - (level of confidence) where the confidence interval straddles zero
interpretation of p-value:

• smaller p-value means more statistically significant

– usually the threshold for saying something is “statistically significant” is p-value of

0.05

– anything below 0.05 means statistically significant

• p-value is the probability that the difference we see in sample means is due to chance

– hence the smaller the p-value the less likely the difference is a fluke...

A simpler way to compute p-values 


• finding the point where the confidence interval straddles zero is equivalent to 

X¯ − Y¯ =  (z-value) · stderror[X¯ − Y¯ ] 

• we solve this for the z-value and call it the test statistic or

 t-stat [(z-value) =] t-stat = (X¯ − Y¯ )/square root( sX^2/ n + Sy^2/ m) 

• then we see how much area lies in the two tails of the normal table and this is the p-value

You misunderstood the professor's meaning. What he is referring to is that the average number of bathroom for ALL samples is 2, the average room for ALL samples is 8 and the average years for ALL samples is 10. That is why you need to use the entire sample size.

If the average of those features for ALL samples differ from 2, 8, 10 (only a subset has such average), as what you mentioned, there will be other ways of calculating the confidence interval, which was not taught by professor.

1. If the p-value is not significant, you should drop the intercept. You can run regression without intercept.

2. In simple linear regression $y=ax+b$, you first calculate $\hat{b}$ then calculate the estimated intercept as $$\hat{a}=\overline{y}-\hat{b}\overline{x}$$

In multiple linear regression model $y=X\beta$, the intercept estimation is the first entry of$$\hat{\beta}=\left(X^TX\right)^{-1}X^TY$$

Prediction interval is always for a prediction value ( either a single point or average) and  provides an estimate of how much  the predicted value varies, depending on the std error of the estimate. 

Confidence interval is always associated only with coefficients of the independent variable and is useful in estimating how significant it is in predicting the dependent variable, depending on the coefficient value and its standard error.

I think your understanding is right, as prediction interval gives a range for predicted value, and confidence interval gives a range of coefficients of explanatory variables. If the confidence interval covers 0, we will not treat the explanatory variable as significant (if the confidence interval covers 0, absolute value of t-statistics should not exceed critical value).

We have a variance decomposition as$$MSE\left(\hat{\theta}\right)=E\left[\left(\hat{\theta}-\theta\right)^2\right]+E\left[\hat{\theta}-\theta\right]^2$$

where the first term is variance and the second term is bias squared. Here $\theta$ is the true value of parameter, while $\hat{\theta}$ is the estimated value of this parameter.

You want to get a low value of MSE (or RMSE equivalently), you need to balance variance and bias. High $\lambda$ will zero-out the parameters, which has low variance but high bias. Small $\lambda$ will allow overfit, which has high variance but low bias. So you need to select a moderate $\lambda$ to minimize MSE.

Typically, in order to choose a proper $\lambda$, you need to do cross-validation. First, you split the whole dataset into two parts: training set and test set. You use training set to run regression with different values of $\lambda$ and get the regression parameters $\hat{\beta}(\lambda)$, which is a function of $\lambda$. Then you apply the regression model to the test set, and compute the MSE (or loss function) of the test set with different values of $\lambda$. Then you pick the value of $\lambda$ which minimizes MSE of your testing dataset.

Summarize this procedure: (1) Split the data into training and test set, (2) run regression only on training set to get parameters $\hat{\beta}$, (3) cross validate to minimize MSE only on test set to get hyper parameter $\lambda$.

This is what I understood. 

a. We use training data to vary lambda and and based on the returned coefficient parameters ( t statistic, p value)  , formulate the model i.e select the independent variables . 

b . Next , run the above model on test data and check which lambda value gives the least MSE. Here we dont look into the coefficient value . Am i right ? 

Also , we do use  ( train----> validate -----> test ) processes too , where in data is split into three portions . 

Then can I use train and validate data to test steps a) and b) and then do a final check on  MSE of test data for the selected hyperparameter lambda and model features. ??

If you want to get an estimation of MSE, you need to split the data into three parts: training, cross-validation, test data, and you run regression with regularization on training data with different lambdas to get the coefficients, and cross-validate these models on cross-validation data to minimize MSE. Finally, your model with optimized lambda will be applied on test data to get an estimation for MSE.

= “total variability in the data”

Regression Sum of Squares =SSR=( ˆ Y1− ¯ Y )^2+· · ·+( ˆ Yn− ¯ Y )^2

= “explained variability”

Error Sum of Squares =SSE=(Y1− ˆ Y1)^2+· · ·+(Yn− ˆ Yn)^2

= “unexplained variability”

Fact of variabilities: SST = SSR + SSE





Degrees of Freedom (DF)

Start with n = # observations (e.g., houses in sample)

We lose one DF for every variable we estimate

• Total DF = n − 1 

• Regression DF = k =  no of  independent  vars. 

• Residual DF = n − k − 1 = remaining dof after estimating all coefficients.

Residual DF = effective sample size

Remark:

• When estimating μ with ¯X , wanted n>=30 (dof=n−1)

• If n = 30 and we are estimating 20 parameters, dof= 30 − 20 − 1 = 9.

Probably sample size is not big enough!





Mean Square Regression (MSR)=explained variability/Regression DF

=

SSR/k



Mean Square Error (MSE)=unexplained variability/Residual DF

=

SSE / n − k − 1

Stdev(error) in the regression equation is square root (MSE)

This standard error can be used to compute CI on predictions

F-test = MSR/MSE . p value associated with this statistic should be small for the model to be significant.

For a single variable linear regression, the regression coefficient of the independent variable (beta1)  is equal to the correlation value between them .



R square = 1 – (Residual sum of squares/ Total sum of squares)  OR Regression Residual / Total Residual .

To check for Homoscedasticity, 

1.    Plot the residual (actual value – predicted value) against each independent variable. Observe that residuals are uniformly distributed for all the values of the independent variable

2.    Plot residuals against the fitted values. 



Heteroscedasticity observed if there exists a pattern in the residuals.



Solution for Heteroscedasticity :- transformation of the response variable – logarithmic , square root, power transformation . 



Steps in Linear Regression: 

1.    Look into the correlation matrix.

2.    Look into the scatter plot of dependent and independent variables.

3.    Look into the distribution of the response variable.

4.    Build a model with the relevant variables identified in the exploratory phase.

5.    Look into RMSE, R2 , Fstat for strength of the model.

6.    Look into the coefficients of the independent variables and check for significance.

7.    Look for multicollinearity between the independent variables.

8.     Check for Homoscedasticity. If not, check if transformation of the response variable helps.

9.    Repeat Step 4 onwards, adding or removing variables so that we have a lean model. 

10.    Once a “good” model is identified on the training data, test the model on ‘hold out’ or test data and check for overfitting.",Vidya M Shankar,,vmshankar30@gmail.com,,,,BAMM102,100/discussion/5001,verified,

The video says, $$\max_z\ E\left[z^2\right]-E\left[z\right]^2$$

is equivalent to $$\max_z\ E\left[z^2\right]$$

This comes from the simple fact that the mean of z is given by$$E\left[z\right]=\mu$$

It makes no difference to your optimal solution to add a constant term into the objective function.

All the decision variables (Xa, Xb, Xc, Xd) are decided at different time. At T = 0, we have choices for Xa, Xb and Xd. At T = 1, we have choice for Xc only.

For your first question, since 100 is the amount we have at the beginning of year 1(T = 0) and we cannot invest in option C at that time, so all the available options (A, B and money market will make up to the total of 100).

For your second question, again, since Xd has already been decided at T = 0, that is, Xd amount of money has been invested in the money market, that is NOT the cash we have at T = 1.

Some clarification required for the following : 

# Approach 2: create loops to create decision variables and constraints. 

Here we are adding 10,000 variables in a loop - z[i] . This stands for the predicted/calculated value .

The objective is to minimise (y[i] - z[i] ) i.e the error term. 

Since we need the absolute value of the error term , we add two constraints (y[i] - z[i]) <= 0 as well as (y[i] - z[i]) >= 0 . 

Whys the term ""m.setObjective(z[0], GRB.MINIMIZE)"" given . Here z[0] is the first error term .

The logic I have understood  as per the video explaination :

 1. Create  a  variable e[i] . ( We also need to create  w[i] variables that are the coefficients , b - intercept)

2. Add the following constraints 

e[i] >= (aTx[i] + b - y[i] ) and 

e[i] <= (aTx[i] + b - y[i] ).

3. Objective : minimise sum of e[i] 

Hope I have understood correctly !

is not a guidance for this specific problem, but just an example about how to set objective function in Gurobi. If you have already known how to do it, you can just leave out the comment part in the code.

In addition, if you want to minimize$$\left|y-z\right|$$

The objective function is$$z=\sum_{i=1}^N\left|y_i-\left(w^Tx_i+b\right)\right|$$

Then $z$ should be a scalar, $w$ should be a vector with the size of $x_i$ (vector of size 10*1), and $b$ is a scalar. Basically, we try to fit a line $y=w^Tx+b$ with the samples $(x_i,y_i),i=1,...,N$, and the objective function is absolute value difference, not sum of squared errors like ordinary linear regression.

The detailed process for variable substitution of fractional linear programming is already included in the lecture video. After you define $u_0$ and $u_j$ for $j=1,2,...,n$, the objective and constraints can be transformed into linear forms:



As for the transformation between $x$ and $u$, we have $$\frac{c^Tx+\alpha}{d^Tx+\beta}=\frac{c^Tx}{d^Tx+\beta}+\alpha u_0=\sum_{_{i=1}}^n\frac{c_ix_i}{d^Tx+\beta}+\alpha u_0\ =\sum_{_{i=1}}^nc_iu_i+\alpha u_0=c^Tu+\alpha u_0$$

and the transformation for the constrains follow the same procedure.

You have 4 constraints (including variable constraints such as x1 >= 0) in your problem and x is in $R^2$ space. You can select 2 constraints to be active, i.e. let left hand side equal to right hand side, then solve the equation. After solving the linear equation system, you should verify whether other inactive constraints are feasible. Say, if you select x1 + x2 >=18 and x1 >= 0, you solve x1+x2 = 18 and x1 = 0, and you get (0,18). Then you verify 3x1 + 4x2 ≥ 60 and x2 >= 0. The vertex (0.14) should be wrong.

This method can be generalized. If you have m constraints (Ax >= b) and n variable constraints (x >= 0), you just pick n of them to be active, then there is $\frac{n!}{(n-m)!m!}$ ways to select including multiplicities. Then verify the remaining m constraints.

When you construct the two slack variables s1 and s2. There will be two more constraints that s1>=0, s2>=0 since x1+2x2≤30  and x1+x2≤20. Otherwise it does not make sense that we add negative variables and make them sum up to the right hand side. Thus we will not accept optimal solutions when s1 and s2 are negative.

There are more advanced algorithms which solve linear programming much faster, but these algorithms are beyond the scope of this course as they are quite complicated. Learning simplex is a tool for us to understand linear programming, but it is still very elementary so it would not be used in real-world.

Thank you for your interest in the Data, Model and Decisions course!

We appreciate that you are eager to join the course and we also understand your concern. Please kindly find our explanations below.



If you want to register as a verified track student, you will have to finish 8 assignments by Dec 8th, 2019. And you also need to take two finals from both BA1 and BA2 course which you need to pass. In addition, you need to pay $320 for the verified track. If you stop halfway and resume in the next semester, you need to pay the fee again.

Otherwise you may wait until the next semester to be enrolled in the course. Meanwhile you can watch the videos first to familiarize yourself with the concepts.

These are just course logistics, which we want to make it clear for you. However, we would like to provide more personal feedback if you can give us more information about yourself.

Regarding BA1: Analytics in Python, please remember that you have to take the final exam to earn the certificate.

To continue this conversation, would you be able to share a few things about yourself, so we can help you make an informed decision: 



What is your purpose for enrolling in the class? Is it for personal interest, academic or professional development?

Do you have any prior knowledge/experience with optimization?

Use numpy.dot(matrix A, matrix x) and loop through the resultant array to add the constraints . This creates the required equation : a0x0 + a1x1 + a2x2 .... a9x9

for eg :- Ax = numpy.dot(A,x)

for i in range(N):

 model.addConstr(useAx[i]...) . 

2. use the Gurobipy function max_()  to set the maximum constraint i.e max_var = maximum of a list of values.

for eg  r_max == max_(list)

Hope it helps . I am myself trying to go through a lot of examples in  Gurobi Python to familarize with how optimization is done in Gurobi python. !

Pls help me understand the qs in Assignment 4 . I have submitted the assignment but is marked  wrong for q1 - A and b. 

q1 : We return back A , b and c as instructed . 

b - list of given contstraints b0 to b3.

c - profit for every demand returned as list.

A - here , I am returning an array of size (100 X 4) which stand for data columns a1...a4. 

The insruction mentions the following which I couldn't decipher .

Note: When you construct the matrix A (lists within list), the first 4 rows will correspond to the capacity constraints and the following 100 rows will correspond to the upper bound of  xi  for i=1...100 

So does this mean , we need to return an array of size 104 *4 ? where in first 4 rows will be b1,b2,b3,b4  and followed by data columns a1 ....a4 ? 

Also , didnt understand the need of matrix A to be as above ? 

Thanks !

yes A should be 104X4.

first four rows is the capacity constraints and following 100 rows is the upper bound using the data in the file “data_online_allocation.csv” which simulates the demand for N=100.

The need to transforming the problem into the standard form is to make it easier to implement in Gurobi.

For your information,  the feasible region of linear programming without integer constraints always contains the feasible region with integer constraints. In other words, if you work out an optimal solution in integer values without integer constraints, it must be the optimal solution to the linear programming with integer constraints.

As for the variable type problem, I think it results from some settings in how Gurobi handles binary variable optimizations. Don't worry about it.

MCFNP is just an alternative way of formulating the inventory problem. In essence the two methods are the same.

As for the solutions, if the cost and capacity are integers then your solutions should be integers. If not, then the solutions might not be integers.

I'm sorry that the original problem has some issue, but we have already fixed it and updated the answers. You can try again.

For Q2, if the variable of optimization problem is n-dimensional, non-degenerate vertex means exactly n constraints in ""$a_i^Tx\geq b_i$"" and ""$x_i\geq0$"" active active. A degenerate vertex means there are strictly more than n constraints are active. Currently, you can verify that all the vertices in Q1 is non-degenerate. So to check whether a new constraint causes degeneracy is equivalent to check whether the new constraint is active in one of the vertices.

For this question, the optimal solution should be one or more of the vertices. So the procedure for this question is:



Since the variable x is in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we should firstly pick up three constraint and set them to be active, and verify the feasibility of all other inactive constraints, to solve for vertices.

Compare the objective function value at each vertex of the feasible region

The maximum of objective function values at vertices is the global maximum value of the LP, based on Simplex method.

Both Business Analytics and Data Science focus on data analytics. However, Data Science puts more emphasis on algorithm/machine learning/artificial intelligence. It is considered closer to ""Computer Science"". Business Analytics, on the other hand, involves more statistical analysis and using models to generate business insight. The purpose is to help business decision makers make more informed decisions. Though there will also be machine learning techniques involved, it won't go as deep as Data Science.

In terms of career path, Business Analytics graduates can assume careers in business and corporate organizations and help with decision making/customer insight, etc. to improve the business. Data Science people may have broader career choices since they can go to any companies that need data science (e.g. technology/biomedical firm, etc.).

Bellman Ford Algorithm is a basic algorithm for solving shortest path problems. Routing apps use similar algorithms but with much more complicated geographical information (e.g. traffic information). The main disadvantages of Bellman Ford Algorithm could be the scalability issue since it takes a long time to compute for large network. On the other hand, changes in network structure are not updated quickly since it is spread node by node.

I went through your submission and got what you were confused. Here is the hint:

There are two types of constraints for $x$, that is (I) $a_i^Tx\leq b_i$ for $i=1,2,3,4$, and (II) $x_i\leq 1$ for $i=1,2,...,100$. Then $A$ in your optimizer should be

and corresponding $b$ should be$$b=\left(\left[b_1,b_2,b_3,b_{4,}1,...,1\right]^T\right)_{104\times1}$$

Following this convention, $Ax\leq b$ will cover both constraints (I) and (II) at the same time. This is the general way dealing with upper-bound constraints.

The rule to check for arbitrage is  for eg R12 X R23 X R34 X R41 >1  is arbitrage and <= 1 as no arbitrage where R12 etc are the exchange rates.

Only when this product is greater than 1, you end up getting more than 1 currency with initial 1 currency, which is defined as arbitrage. For case of product<=1, you are losing money at the end of the day. 

Even when the increase is 1/1000, that means you get 1.001 USD from initial cost 1 USD, you can make a huge amount of money by increasing you initial money. For example, when you invest 1 billion in the market, you can get profit of 1 million without risk.

I would also like to add that I've been having trouble understanding what the assignment is asking exactly. My issue is, when I calculate the total_processing_time and the optimal_schedule, I do not receive any marks but when I remove those calculations, I am receiving credit for calculating these two variables. I am very confused by this. The autograder seems to give me credit on my model which then implies that total_processing_time and optimal_schedule are derived? The autograder is also telling me that my objective function is wrong which is also confusing me. Isn't my objective function based on my model? And if the autograder is marking my model correctly, how can my objective function be incorrect?

Another thing that I have noticed is if I'm setting my objective function to either maximize c^Tx or minimize c^Tx, the autograder accepts both of these answers. How can this be? I looked at the output of the decision variables using both methods and they are both different thereby creating different optimal schedules with different optimal objective values. How can both be correct?

I am also having these issues with assignment 5 as well where we are dealing with a matching problem between servers and jobs where the same issue is happening for me where the removal of optimal_allocation and total_cost seems to give me more marks. And the explicit output or calculations of optimal_allocation and total_cost removes marks.

Can someone please provide some help on assignment 8 as well as assignment 5? I must be missing something here. I would greatly appreciate it!

Thank you for this response. I have tried utilizing this approach in a different assignment (the matching problem in assignment 8 as they both are similar problems) and this does not appear to change the score. Can you please look into this? I have also posted this quesion in the project 8 thread where the autograder doesn't seem to reflect the correct response. 

As I mentioned in that thread for project 8, if I remove the total_cost and optimal allocation variables, I am getting 4/5 on the assignment where the objective function is not getting any marks but the autograder indicates that the total_cost and optimal allocation variables are correct(?). And let me be clear, I'm not changing or manipulating any of the code that was designed for the assignment, by removing the total_cost and optimal_allocation variables, I mean that I'm not calculating these variables. 

This must mean that I'm missing something or not understanding something about the assignment if this is the case. Can you please let me know?

If I do include these variables and submit the assignment, the autograder will indicate that total_cost and optimal_allocation are incorrect but the model or objective function is correct. In either case, if I choose to maximize -c^Tx or maximize c^Tx, I get the same marks.

I feel that I am very close in completing both assignment 8 and assignment 5 and I would like to understand why I am unable to receive full marks for each assignment as this is quite frustrating on my end.

for the second question, I don't quite get the question for this one, so the basic idea is to formulate the constraints into a matrix form where A is a matrix and b is a vector. Could you explain in more details what is your confusion?

Thanks for all the help provided during the course . I would like to give my quick inputs for this course : 

1. Absolutely loved the topics . They are very new to me, and I am taking this course for a career change and just loved solving the business problems whether they involved business statistics or optimisation problems.

2. Quite a wide range of topics . 

3. How ever , not at all satisfied with how few topics are explained, specifically  sensitivity analysis , duality theory . Especially , if this course has no much pre requisites and assumes that every person here is new to the topic.

4. I fell short of time to complete the exam . Especially those involving Gurobi Python codes. 

30 mins more would suffice. 

5. Having time shared the course with my work, fell short of time to practise extra out of the given material. So may be the course duration too needs to be re-looked . 

6. Give an option to retry the exam for the sake of those who didn't pass or want to score higher. (with an extra cost if need be ) so that they don't have to redo the entire course. 

These are my sincere feedback , given the fact that many of us who are working hard and putting time in MicroMaster's course , is with a purpose of passing the course (at the least) and to actually be able to learn and apply it in our  future (or current) work. 

Providing my inputs here as the course survey was just too short !! :)

Due to the complication of the proctoring software, the course staff decided to extend the course due date until December 23rd, 2019, 23:30 UTC to let you take (or retake) the proctored final exam. Before you proceed, please make sure you follow these steps before you take the final exam:



Take the practice proctored exam to verify your system compatibility


Use your edX credential to log-in for the final proctored exam



If you use other 3rd party (i.e. facebook or google account) login, you will not be able to access to the final exam. 


Close all other tabs, communication apps or any add-on software (i.e. Skype or Messenger) to prevent any pop-up message which could result in your exam flagged as violating the proctor exam rules. 


There can be many background data using apps you have installed on personal laptops, or network blocking security systems in corporate computers. Each of these can make PSI flag your exam. Therefore, the simpler the computer used, the better. An option is to log in as a ‘guest’ user on your computers (but then, this depends on if you downloaded PSI under all users or your admin account).

If your exam gets locked out or blocked, note that the timer still runs. When it ends, your exam will be submitted for you. We understand this is an issue, and the best resolution is to contact info@edx.org to reset your exam and report this on the discussion forum. PSI cannot reset exams, but they can determine why you were logged out. 



We are here to assist you if you have any other questions.

Be constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.
 
Be sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.
 
Post appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.
 
Users that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.
 
Please help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.
 
In addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!

FORUM POSTING GUIDELINES

What makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:
 
Read before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.
 
Use informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.
 
Make it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.
 
Stay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.
 
Help keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff.

When the CA team tried to build up a python notebook as tutorial for using DIRECT algorithm, we have found a great Python library that works exceptionally well in solving the optimization problem using DIRECT algorithm called “scipy”. The function spicy.optimize.minimize allows you to use the Fortran implementation written by Joerg.M.Gablonsky, DIRECT Version 2.0.4. 

The detailed tutorial of using the package is provided in https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html#id17.

Since we believe that you don’t need to reinvent the wheel but use them to solve real world problems, it is recommended to use the sample code provided in the Jupyter Notebook to implement the DIRECT algorithm. Please make sure you download the library scipy before running the code. This library should be pre-installed if you use Anaconda Navigator to open Jupyter Notebook.",Wenshan Liang,admin,wenshan.liang@columbia.edu,Haythamomar,,haythamomar1988@yahoo.com,BAMM103,103/discussion/2689,,audit

In video 2.6: To find the minimum optimal solution, we require the gradient of the function is proportional, is in the same direction, as the gradient of the constraint. Then, Professor  introduced Lagrangian & lambda, where lambda is a constant number for making the proportional relationship of the two into a equality condition, to solve the math (which is: gradient of the f(x,y) + lambda * gradient of g(x,y) = 0).


Remember that Lambda is always a constant. In the optimal pricing case under supply constraint,  Lagrangian says that: the gradient of profit (which is the number of unites in direction of objective we want to maximize) + lambda * the gradient of C (which is 1 unit in direction of capacity constraint ) = 0. Thus lambda is the extra profit I'd make if I increase the capacity by 1 unit, which is moving in the direction of constraint.


If you find the idea confusing, I would suggest you go back to video 2.6 and the example starting from 8:00min to understand what does 1 unit increase in the gradient of the constraint means to the objective.


And this link https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/applications-of-multivariable-derivatives/constrained-optimization/a/interpretation-of-lagrange-multipliers walks an example about Lagrangian multiplier lambda, which you might find helpful understanding it.


Please let us know if you have more questions.

If you have imported the pandas library, I do not see any problem with the part you loading the data using pd.read_csv. This is exactly how to read in the csv file to python. Make sure you need to have the entire data file direction in order for the python to read in the file properly. For example, pricing_data = pd.read_csv(""/Users/xxx/xxxx/pricing_data.csv"", dtype = str)

The code below works just as fine. Please compare to see if there is any parts that makes the difference.

And if you want to get more practice and refresh on Python skills, there is a course called Analytics in Python ( https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-in-python ) that you may want to check out.

We found out that some of you might have questions about week 1 quiz and we summarized a few key takeaways for you to review. 

In economics, a commodity is an economic good or service that has full or substantial fungibility: that is, the market treats instances of the good as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them. The wide availability of commodities typically leads to smaller profit margins and diminishes the importance of factors (such as brand name) other than price.

Hope you find it helpful.

The conditional probability allows you to calculate the probability of event A happens given that event B happened. Bayes formula says this probability is equivalent to the probability that event A and B happen at the same time (P(A∩B)) divided by probability of event B happens (P(B)).",Wenshan Liang,admin,wenshan.liang@columbia.edu,,,,BAMM103,103/discussion/5379,,

You may find the folllowing tips useful:

1. Review basic probability before start week 1
2. Watch course videos one by one, and do the ungraded questions under each video
3. Review the course content before doing the quiz of the week. The quizzes are good practice for you to better understand the concepts. You may not find it extremely challenging if you understand the materials taught in course videos.
4. Assignments in week 3,5,7,9 include case analysis that will allow you to practice more.
5. Please keep an eye on the Ed discussion forum. TAs will periodically upload learning tips where learners feel challenging to understand during their study.

Sorry for the delay on the question. Since this is a csv file, the very first and straightforward way pd.read_csv(path) works. The code itself is correct, maybe you want to check if your file path is appropriate to use. To make things easier, you could move the file to the same folder as your python file, and then just do pd.read_csv(""concert_data.csv"").

P.S. From the several options you tried, header = None does not work because in this case you removed the column names, and sep = '\t' does not work because the seperater for csv to read into pandas is sep=','.

Please let the team know if you have further questions.

I do intend to continue the program and not jus this course so I hope the proctoring software issue gets resolved.

While I understand the background checks and monitoring needs, the software is extremely sensitive and doesn’t seem to allow for data speed variations and standard system checks and updates which shouldn’t violate exam rules. It’s as if the software is asking for a siloed system with no connections to the outside world except itself which is very hard to achieve

We only permit a physical calculator but not a digital one. These are the only materials you are allowed to bring during the exam. 



No books and no handouts are allowed. 

Students are allowed to use one A4 size, two-sided cheat sheet. This can have any notes you would like to write on it. It can be either hand-written or typed notes.

Students are allowed to have empty scratch paper, up to 10 pages. 

Students may use a hardcopy/printed normal distribution table (download here) and a calculator. 

Basically, you are being flagged for having suspicious behavior. The practice proctor exam only test your computer system (operation system, camera, and microphone). You can write a petition to the edX course to see if you are given a second chance.

Due to the complication of the proctoring software, the course staff decided to extend the course due date until December 23rd, 2019, 23:30 UTC to let you take (or retake) the proctored final exam. Before you proceed, please make sure you follow these steps before you take the final exam:



Take the practice proctored exam to verify your system compatibility



Use your edX credential to log-in for the final proctored exam



If you use other 3rd party (i.e. facebook or google account) login, you will not be able to access to the final exam. 



Close all other tabs, communication apps or any add-on software (i.e. Skype or Messenger) to prevent any pop-up message which could result in your exam flagged as violating the proctor exam rules. 



There can be many background data using apps you have installed on personal laptops, or network blocking security systems in corporate computers. Each of these can make PSI flag your exam. Therefore, the simpler the computer used, the better. An option is to log in as a ‘guest’ user on your computers (but then, this depends on if you downloaded PSI under all users or your admin account).

If your exam gets locked out or blocked, note that the timer still runs. When it ends, your exam will be submitted for you. We understand this is an issue, and the best resolution is to contact info@edx.org to reset your exam and report this on the discussion forum. PSI cannot reset exams, but they can determine why you were logged out. 


We are here to assist you if you have any other questions.

I followed all of the steps you mentioned here and tried to take the final exam again. The exam shut down again with the camera error that was mentioned here multiple times. I called PSI Support (proctoring software company); they couldn't log me back in and so they opened a ticket. My internet connection and setup passed all the network tests that the representative carried out. I submitted the ticket information to info@edx.org and still haven't received a reply. This is the second time this exact issue happening to me and at this point I am seriously running out of time in terms of repeating this process and finding the time to retake the exam. I am working a full time job that goes beyond the regular 9-5 and finding the time/place to take the test multiple times has been a real challenge.

I am repeating this here as I am trying to get the Certificate (i.e. taking all of the courses in sequence) and applying to Columbia's Masters Program in Business Analytics in the coming February. The FAQ page says that we should earn the certificate before we apply to the program to get our credits counted and at this point I am seriously losing hope about it. Please either find an alternative to this problem, or let me (and anyone who is interested in doing the same) repeat the course again and still get it counted for the grad school applications, coming this January/February.

Let me share my experience on the PSI Secure Browser.  As many had encountered, I also got the ""bandwidth"" issue which reason was identified by the Secure Software support.  My resolution was 1) to use more powerful CPU, 2) to use lower resolution display,  and 3) to avoid using a PDF reader.

When I took the practice exam with Dell XPS 13 (screen resolution: 3200x1800), the practice was so smooth, and I did not get any issues.  At that time I did not use any other software (as PSI Secure Browser request the confirmation to kill such software), did not browse any other material including Columbia University webpages.  I thought I have no issue with that testing environment.

I took the final exam on Tuesday in the original final week.  I used the same PC in the same wired network environment (which I later measured upstream at 300Mbps, downstream at 700Mbps).  This time I tried to use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to view my notes and the handouts in digital form.  At the 2nd question I wanted to confirm the answer on the handout, and started to flip pages.  Then I was kicked out of the exam.  I contacted the Secure Software and got to know that the reason of disconnection was insufficient bandwidth, which seems a little weird.

I thought it might be the nature of the PSI Secure Browser, because such software should be used also at real test center typically carrying out closed-book tests.  If so, it needs to detect cheating through running other software.  Although the use PDF reader is allowed in our case, running some other software might be affecting in a bad way.  The browser also reminded me at the booting time that it uploads the image from webcam, and all the activity on the screen is recorded.  So it would make sense to think that the use of PDF reader became a big load for the laptop's CPU to compress such higher resolution screen to upload, and it would be possible that such load resulted and/or was detected as insufficient bandwidth.

Based on that assumption, when I retook the exam, I prepared a box PC with a powerful CPU and more memory.  I connected a full-HD (1920x1080) display instead of one with higher resolution.  I also prepared my notes and the handouts in physical form to avoid the use of the PDF reader.  It was a very good experience to take the proctored exam which went so smooth until the end of the exam.  I really enjoyed the final exam.",Shu-Yi,admin,sh3146@columbia.edu,Jiaoyue1994,,jiaoyue94@163.com,BAMM103,103/discussion/13202,audit,verified

FORUM POSTING GUIDELINES

What makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:
 
Read before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.
 
Use informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.
 
Make it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.
 
Stay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.
 
Help keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff.

Thank you for your question!

In the quadrant analysis, we related customer perceived value to brand by firstly identifying the attributes of different brands and collect customers' opinions on the importance of them. Then we have customers rated different brands on those attributes. We can use the same method to relate customer perceived value to lifestyle. For example, getting up early, doing exercise every day, reading a book every week, etc can be the attributes for lifestyles. Customers will give different importance scores on those attributes and we also have different lifestyles like ourdoorsy, austere, nomatic, etc. Then we can relate customers values with those lifestyles by giving scores on their attributes.


Cases in this course are mainly for product marketing. The lifestyle is more like a concept than a product or we can relate a product to a lifestyle. The instructors will go step by step to teach how to do customer segementation and target marketing.

Let's take an example from the second week, segmentation. The basic concept of segmentation was argued using an example of a Barbie doll, and then some benefits were given, but that really, in my humble opinion does not give a rational explanation of ""why"" there is such a concept in marketing.

According to (Market Segmentation: Conceptual and Methodological Foundations by Wedel & Kamakura), in order for segmentation to work, there needs to be 6 criteria fulfilled: identifiability, substantiality, accessibility, stability, responsiveness and actionability. You may read about these criteria in the book, but to illustrate the point, no mathematical segmentation would be done unless these are satisfied.

I am struggling with data transformation. I know that responses to some media variable (such as TV) are in the shape of an S-curve, but I don't know how to transform the raw data to obtain this.

Log transformations are often used in literature, but this doesn't provide the S-shape.

I work for a consulting firm and I would like to know your experience on applying segmentation to B2B clients. I'm asking because the characteristics of events related to volume, frequency and interactions are less and given that this is sensitive to quantity of data, just wondering on ways to implement this. I think it's applicable but I've had some teammates challenging this approach saying this is more applicable to retail for example and not ""relations"" kind of business.

I've not touched consulting before, and my main focus is on quantitative finance. But from my understanding for this practical problem, B2B business is more complex since its customer and market type. I just went through some papers and blogs online and found these might be helpful to you:

The majority rule means that you should pick the number of clusters that has the most supporting criteria. From the lecture, no other number of clusters have more than 7 supporting criteria, so we should choose 3 clusters.

As for 19>7, you can try increasing the number of clusters from 3 to 4,5,6,... But you will find that the supporting criteria for 4,5,6... clusters will be smaller than 7, which means 3 clusters are optimal.

I think you can try to understand this from maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The parameter to estimate here is the number of clusters N. You can think criteria as has higher probability if the number of clusters is optimal under this criteria, and we are giving equal weights to each criteria. Our assumption is that each criteria is independent.



In MLE, our goal is$$\max_{N\in\left\{N_{\min},N_{\min}+1,...,N_{\max}\right\}}\prod_{i=1}^mPcri_i\left(N\right)$$

where $Pcri_i(N)$ means the probability of i-th criteria with number of clusters N. We can think this function asymptotically as$$Pcri_i\left(N\right)=1,\ if\ N\ is\ optimal\ for\ criteria\ i$$

and $$Pcri_i\left(N\right)=0.1,\ if\ N\ is\ not\ optimal\ for\ criteria\ i$$



Under this roadmap, N with the most supporting criteria will be the optimal number of clusters.



Also you can have an abstract proof here.

You can use the 'modelNames' argument for the Mclust() function.

Welcome to the Marketing Analytics course!


Our course materials (videos, slides, codes and ungraded quizzes) are available to audit learners till Dec 24th, 2019. Verified learners will have lifelong access to course materials. 

In order to access to graded assessments such as quizzes, assignments and final exam, you will have to enroll in the verified track. 

In order to get the grades, learners still need to follow the timeline:

    Finish all graded quizzes and assignments before Dec 8th 23:30 UTC

    Finish the final exam during Dec 9th 00:00 UTC - Dec 16th 23:30 UTC


Hope you enjoy the course!

Welcome to the Marketing Analytics course!

We understand your concern. As our staff, Fulei, explained, all the quizzes’ and the final exam’s due dates are fixed because this is an instructor-paced course.

You may be wondering if it is too late to enroll in the verified track--based on our student record for the past 2 years, however, students who enrolled late actually have a positive correlation to a higher total grade. We suspect that learners enrolling in the course late are more conscientious with their study planning and deadlines. That said, if you can budget your study time accordingly, you will still be able to complete the course.

In addition, enrolling as a verified student provides access to the graded assessments, which have been carefully designed to help you apply theory to real-life challenges. Our course assistants are also available if you have any questions or concerns!

To continue this conversation, would you be able to share a few things about yourself, so we can help you make an informed decision:

What is your purpose for enrolling in the class? Is it for personal interest, academic or professional development?
Do you have any prior knowledge/experience with Marketing Analytics?
What does your schedule look like, i.e. how much time you can budget for the class per week?

Feel free to reach out in the discussion forum.

Good luck!

Recall that in the lecture R code, when we use Nbclust(), the input data should not have colinearity issue. For each row, the sum of (""Trendy"", ""Styling"", ""Reliability"", ""Sportiness"", ""Performance"", ""Comfort"") is 100, which means it has colinearity and that is the reason we exclude the last column.

I have been having some trouble with this assignment. 

I made some errors when loading the data so I got my first two questions wrong. After that, I realized that the data was wrong and fixed it to answer questions 3-7. However, in question 8 ""Examine the factor $weights. What is the weight of variable “talkative” in computing the scores of the RC1 factor?"" when I run my code I don't see any of the values that are available as answer. I don't know what I am doing wrong. Could you please offer some guidance?

This is my code:

library(psych)

test_scores = read.csv(file = ""Personalitydata.xls"")
fit <- principal(test_scores[, 2:13],nfactors=5, rotate=""none"")

fit

fit$weights

Verified learners will get certificated if they score 60% or above of the total grades, which include quizzes (20%), assignments (30%) and final Exam (50%).

After following the instructions in the preliminary, you should get a result of 8.9 instead of 6.75. Apology for the inconvenience.

Thank you for the recap. I am running the right versions (using R studio IDE) and restarted my computer but get stuck in the example code when trying to compute the scenarios individually.

I thought the issue came from the GA version installation; but I checked using session_info() and I see I have GA 3.2 installed which is what you suggest.



I've checked on internet but this doesn't seem to be solved elsewhere.

In general matrix factorization and factor analysis are two different techniques. Factor analysis is using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), by calculating an eigen-decomposition of thee covariance matrix. Differently, matrix factorization is decomposing the user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices, for example, via Funk MF algorithm.

For more information:

1. Factor Analysis / PCA

2. matrix decomposition

This is about customer acquisition. Cumulative percentage of customers means the percentage of customers in the market that buy your product. Cumulative Profits means the profit you can gain from a certain cumulative percentage of customer acquisition.

For example, imagine you were a product analysis of Apple, and your product attract 50% customers in the market with profit of $1 billion. If you want to attract 60% customers, you need pay more for advertisement and others, but you revenue will also increase as you sell more. Then whether your profit will increase depends on whether your extra revenue overwhelms your extra cost. 

So basically, there is trade-off between cumulative percentage of customers and cumulative profits, which should be an inverse U-shape curve.

Thanks for your question.

The first step is to compute for each respondent the utility they will get from each product.$$U_1^{ap}=0.7-2.6+0.8+0.5+0.9=0.3$$$$U_1^{gc}=0.7+0+0-0.3+0=0.4$$$$U_2^{ap}=1.9-0.4+2.5+0.4+0.3=4.7$$$$U_2^{gc}=1.9+0+0-0.3+0=1.6$$$$U_3^{ap}=3.1-0.9-0.8+0.6+2.2=4.2$$$$U_3^{gc}=3.1+0+0-0.6+0=2.5$$

Then for each respondent, you should choose the product that gives the highest utility. So respondent 1 chooses Google, whereas others choose Apple. So Apple TV obtains 2/3 of the market, which approximates 67%.

This question is not completely the same as the market share question. Both of them need to calculate the utility of customers. As for the market share question, you have the utilities of multiple customers towards multiple products and decide the product with highest utility for each customer. However, for this question, there is only one respondent and we calculate the probablity of him choosing one product. The following slide in week 8's lecture talks about choice probability.

This is the code I am using for product optimization:



plData <- read.csv(""C:/Users/Luz Rodriguez/Desktop/Courses 2019/Marketing Analytics/Week8 New Product Design part 2/device_ProductLine.xls"", header=TRUE)
plData$Price <- as.factor(plData$Price)

kable(plData)



status_quo <-apply(Exp_ut[which(newData$Available==1),],2,max)

utils <- matrix(0, nrow = I, ncol = P+1)

colnames(utils) <- c(""status_quo"",paste(""Product"",1:P,sep = ""_""))

rownames(utils) <- paste(""Resp"",1:I,sep = ""_"")

utils[,1] <- status_quo



for(i in 1:I){

  fit <- lm(Ratings[,i]~ Price + BrandOS + Storage + ImageQuality)

  #print(summary(fit_list[[i]]))

  utils[i,2:(P+1)] <- predict(fit, plData)

}

kable(utils)



profit<-function(offered, utils, margin){
  

  offered1<-c(1, offered)

  

  uOffered <- t(apply(utils, 1, function(x)(x * offered1)))

  maxUtil <- apply(uOffered, 1, max)

  

  prodHighest<-matrix(0, nrow(utils), ncol(utils)-1)

  

  for(i in 1:nrow(utils)){

    for(j in 2:ncol(utils)){

      if(uOffered[i, j] == maxUtil[i]) {prodHighest[i,j-1]=1;break}

    }

  }

  profitVec<-apply(prodHighest, 1, function(x){x %*% margin})

  sum(profitVec)

}



obj<-function(offered, utils, margin, numProd){

  

  pr<-profit(offered, utils, margin)

  penalty<-10*max(margin)*abs(sum(offered)-numProd)

  

  pr-penalty

}



set.seed(0)
gaOpt<-ga(""binary"", fitness=obj, utils=utils, margin=margin, numProd=3, nBits=length(margin), maxiter=100)

summary(gaOpt)

sol <- gaOpt@solution
sol

print(paste(""Number of solutions:"",nrow(sol)))

kable(plData[which(c(sol[1,])==1),])



profit(sol[1,], utils, margin)



The answer that I get is : Products 5, 10 and 24, with a maximum profit of 105

I had this problem starting the first assignment and thought that I would be able to figure it out later as I went on with the course but I cannot get the right output in R.

Process : 



Open R, New project, setting up directory where SelfStatedData.csv is.

Installing the packages (NbClust), (mclust)
 I also tried with (gmodels) and running them with the seed : 



set.seed(1990)
library(NbClust)

library(mclust)

Importing the cvs file,

Then, after inputting the example code : 

set.seed(1990)
std_SelfStatedData <- scale(SelfStatedData)

dist <- dist(std_SelfStatedData, method = ""euclidean"") 

as.matrix(dist)[1:5,1:5]

I get the following output :

         1        2        3        4        5
1 0.000000 2.747542 3.807010 1.725367 2.788258

5 2.788258 1.100848 2.633576 3.065549 0.000000

which is different from the output shown in the example :

         1        2        3        4        5
1 0.000000 2.746685 3.804537 1.713049 2.774723

The id column influences normalization when using scale() function. Thus the id column needs to be excluded from SelfStatedData, i.e.

Question 4 says: The manager would now want to fit a logistic distribution to his data. Using the method of moments, what is the value of the mean parameter (m) for this dataset.

I typed in: 84 since R answer is 84.22. However, the grader says that the right answer is ***.  *** is the mean when fitting the data with a normal distribution, while the logistic distribution gives 84.22.

This is the code that I am using 

library(fitdistrplus)
fitw<-fitdist(priceData$Wtp, ""logis"")

This question is asking you to find the mean of the data, that is $$m=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Nx_i$$

If you want to fit a logistic distribution via method of moments, you need 2 parameters, that is $\mu$ and $s$ (see definition here). Then from your sample data, you have sample mean as $m$ and sample variance as $$\sigma^2=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N\left(x_i-m\right)^2$$

Then you will solve the following equation to match the first two moments of logistic distribution:$$\left\{\begin{matrix}\mu=m\\\frac{s^2\pi^2}{3}=\sigma^2\end{matrix}\right\}$$

However, from this formula, your sample mean should be the mean parameter in logistic distribution as well.

Hi Lerodriguez31,

The log likelihood function $\log(f(w;m,s))$ can be negative if $f(w;m,s)<1$. In this case of $m=0,s=1$, the density is$$f\left(w\right)=\frac{e^{-\left(w-1\right)}}{\left(1+e^{-\left(w-1\right)}\right)^2}=\frac{e^{-w+1}}{\left(1+e^{-w+1}\right)^2}$$

And obviously we have$$f\left(w\right)\le\frac{1+e^{-w+1}}{\left(1+e^{-w+1}\right)^2}=\frac{1}{1+e^{-w+1}}\le1$$

For $w=40$ and $w=60$, $1+e^{-w+1}<1$ implies $f(w)<1$, hence $\log(f(w))<0$.

Based on the feedback we have received for the week 8 assignment, there are some different results regarding question 9 and question 10. This is because of some changes in R 3.6.0 that make the default method for generating random numbers different. We decided to add one additional attempt for question 9 and question 10. We truly apologize for the inconvenience.

To get the same result as the answer and get points, you should first run RNGkind(sample.kind = 'Rejection') before running the code. You may get different results when you set ""sample.kind = 'Rounding'"".

Recall in lecture 7, the way of calculating relative importance of attributes is as below:

We first define the get_range() fuction inside the get_importance() function. To calculate the range of each attribute, we find the relevant variables by using grepl() which is a regex function, and save the corresponding coefficient, i.e. partworth into a vector which is called coeff. Thus max(coeff) - min(coeff) is the range we want for a certain attribute.

Then we loop through each attribute and save their ranges into the variable Ranges and calculate the relative importance based on it.

Hope this will help you understand the code better!

Best,

Evelyn

For Q1, the probability of success is $$p\left(x=1\right)=\frac{e^{\beta}}{1+e^{\beta}}$$

and the question is asking for $$\frac{p\left(x=1\right)}{p\left(x=0\right)}-1$$

For Q9, you should utilize the example R codepf<-function(incr, data)
{
  d <- data[data$Churn==""No"",] # only keeping customers that have not churned yet
  d$MonthlyCharges <- d$MonthlyCharges*incr # possible increase in monthly charges (no increase is incr==1.0)
  g <- 0.99 # discount factor (money in the next period is worth 0.99 money in the period before that)
  p <- 1-predict.glm(model, newdata=d, type=""response"") # retention probability based on logistic regresion (we assume retention probability will remain constant for each consumer, conditional on fixed d$MonthlyCharges)
  clv <- d$MonthlyCharges/(1-p*g) # CLV formula
  return(sum(clv)) # sum of discounted profits across all individual consumers
}

That is, modify variable ""incr"" to prediction probability ""p"".

The number of parameters is just how many numbers you need to estimate for the function. Take y = a+b*x as an example, when we feed data (x,y) into this equation, a and b are two parameters we want to estimate.

For question 4 quiz week 10, for multiple independent variables, we have to run a logistic regression, and for the 3rd option it talks about to retain the BIC with the lowest value, that is true, but I don't find any association between logistic regression and BIC so I'm confused with that option. 

Can you help me, please?.

This question is asking about what is the solution when having multiple independent variables that influence the pricing strategy. It is obvious that the model is logistic regression, however, there are different options when using this model. You need to choose the correct one. BIC is a metric to evaluate logistic regression models, the lower the better. It is mentioned in the lecture. Please review the slide as below.

Although I already have a passing score in the course I did not get the chance to complete the exam (I had probably around 15-20 questions left to answer and 40 minutes left). I just think it is really frustrating that I spent quite some time studying for the exam because I wanted a good grade in this course and then not get the chance because of system failure. But since the only option I was given was to repeat the whole exam then I guess I just need to accept that. I see in other courses as well that this is happening to quite a few people so I really do think that this is something that needs to be figured out as it is really unfair to those of us who this happens to.

Thank you for your response. EdX reset my exam and I was able to take it. Unfortunately, when I was in question No. 30 I got the camera message issue. I still had 20 questions left!. 

It is beyond upsetting that after studying hard for the final I am not able to finish the test. 

EdX support mentioned that the camera issue was due to an internet connection but I have an outstanding internet service. I do know that is not the issue.

Reading other classmates' issues I consider the software is the problem here.

Could you please advice on the next steps? How can I finish the final exam?

Overall the course is outstanding and hard. However, having this technical difficulties makes me very upset. I can only take the exam during the weekend and I took the time to review all the content during the week. I think you should reconsider to use a different software or design a different way to take the final exam. 

I have read in other classmates responses that one option is to re-take the test. However, how do I know that I will not get the camera issue again and I will be able to finish the test? Maybe the 2 hour span for the exam is not supported for the software? Again, from other comments I see a common trend of getting this message around one hour after starting. 

I appreciate your support. Please advice what I should do.

Again, I loved the course and I invested too much time on it as for not being able to take and finish the final exam.",Lerodriguez31,,luz.rodriguez@baruchmail.cuny.edu,Evelyn777,admin,zhangfulei7evelyn@163.com,BAMM104,104/discussion/12835,verified,audit

I am really sorry for the second interruption. We are investigating the proctor issue and extending the exam due date to December 23rd, 2019, 23:30 UTC. You have scored over the passing line (60%) which means you will get the certificate for this course.  You don't have to retake the exam if you prefer. Congratulations for completing the course successfully! Great job!

We understand your situation with the unexpected work commitments. 

We are expecting to open the course on February 4th. You can reach out to edX to see if you are still in the grace period for the refund. If not, you will have to enroll for the next run and pay again. 

Here are two reminders for you: 1. the price is lowered for the next course run. 2. You might check if you are qualified for the financial aids. 

Thank you for your enrollment this semester and hope to see you soon!

Due to the complication of the proctoring software, the course staff decided to extend the course due date until December 23rd, 2019, 23:30 UTC to let you take (or retake) the proctored final exam. Before you proceed, please make sure you follow these steps before you take the final exam:



Take the practice proctored exam to verify your system compatibility



Use your edX credential to log-in for the final proctored exam



If you use other 3rd party (i.e. facebook or google account) login, you will not be able to access to the final exam. 



Close all other tabs, communication apps or any add-on software (i.e. Skype or Messenger) to prevent any pop-up message which could result in your exam flagged as violating the proctor exam rules. 



There can be many background data using apps you have installed on personal laptops, or network blocking security systems in corporate computers. Each of these can make PSI flag your exam. Therefore, the simpler the computer used, the better. An option is to log in as a ‘guest’ user on your computers (but then, this depends on if you downloaded PSI under all users or your admin account).

If your exam gets locked out or blocked, note that the timer still runs. When it ends, your exam will be submitted for you. We understand this is an issue, and the best resolution is to contact info@edx.org to reset your exam and report this on the discussion forum. PSI cannot reset exams, but they can determine why you were logged out. 


We are here to assist you if you have any other questions.

Let me share my experience on the PSI Secure Browser.  As many had encountered, I also got the ""bandwidth"" issue which reason was identified by the Secure Software support.  My resolution was 1) to use more powerful CPU, 2) to use lower resolution display,  and 3) to avoid using a PDF reader.

When I took the practice exam with Dell XPS 13 (screen resolution: 3200x1800), the practice was so smooth, and I did not get any issues.  At that time I did not use any other software (as PSI Secure Browser request the confirmation to kill such software), did not browse any other material including Columbia University webpages.  I thought I have no issue with that testing environment.

I took the final exam on Tuesday in the original final week.  I used the same PC in the same wired network environment (which I later measured upstream at 300Mbps, downstream at 700Mbps).  This time I tried to use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to view my notes and the handouts in digital form.  At the 2nd question I wanted to confirm the answer on the handout, and started to flip pages.  Then I was kicked out of the exam.  I contacted the Secure Software and got to know that the reason of disconnection was insufficient bandwidth, which seems a little weird.

I thought it might be the nature of the PSI Secure Browser, because such software should be used also at real test center typically carrying out closed-book tests.  If so, it needs to detect cheating through running other software.  Although the use PDF reader is allowed in our case, running some other software might be affecting in a bad way.  The browser also reminded me at the booting time that it uploads the image from webcam, and all the activity on the screen is recorded.  So it would make sense to think that the use of PDF reader became a big load for the laptop's CPU to compress such higher resolution screen to upload, and it would be possible that such load resulted and/or was detected as insufficient bandwidth.

Based on that assumption, when I retook the exam, I prepared a box PC with a powerful CPU and more memory.  I connected a full-HD (1920x1080) display instead of one with higher resolution.  I also prepared my notes and the handouts in physical form to avoid the use of the PDF reader.  It was a very good experience to take the proctored exam which went so smooth until the end of the exam.  I really enjoyed the final exam.

It is difficult to recommend a specific machine with the best value for the money without knowing your specific needs (plus costs and models can vary a lot from place to place).

Every assignment for this AI course is completed through Vocareum, which runs on a cloud machine, so having a browser that works should suffice. The AI course does not require any specific software, but the Anaconda package is very useful for Python users.

The discussion forums are a way for you to share your thoughts about course material, learn from your fellow students, get to know them better, and report problems.
If you have an urgent matter -- such as needing to report a video or other course component that isn't working properly -- you can get the attention of course staff by creating a new post and putting [STAFF] in the title.
 
There are a few other ways you can participate:
 
Select the ""heart"" icon to like  posts and good responses (so the post will move closer to the top of the discussion thread)
 
Select the “star” icon to follow posts for updates
 
Use “watch” to be notified of all activities in the thread
 
You are part of a diverse learning community that forms the heart of a meaningful learning experience. Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:
Be respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.
Be constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.
 
Be sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.
 
Post appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.
 
Users that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.
 
Please help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.
 
In addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!

FORUM POSTING GUIDELINES

What makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:
 
Read before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.
 
Use informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.
 
Make it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.
 
Stay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.
 
Help keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff.

He also claimed that according to a McKinsey’s research, about 20.000.000 people will probably lose their job only in the Middle East. In the same forum Mr Klaus Schwab, President of the World Economic Forum, predicted that in the next 2 decades ,40% of todays places will be replaced from robots. From the other hand Dr Jim Yong Kim predicted that at the same time 450.000.000 people will be added to the world labor force. So governments has to create about 300.000.000 jobs! 
Is this a threat to humankind? Of course, it is!  Should we worry about it? Of course, we should!
From the other hand a research from the Accenture Institute for High Performance, in collaboration with  Frontier Economics, predicted that the 12 biggest economies of the world will be able to double or triple their growth rate until 2035 because of AI.
In the field of healthcare Adoption of AI could save e.g. the U.S. healthcare industry $150 billion annually by 2026. That means cheaper services in health for everybody. Moreover AI can help for faster predictions and more accurate treatments.  
Is this a bless to humankind? Of course, it is!
 When we are talking about AI or robots, we think of a machine that can perceives its environment, a machine that can make predictions via calculations, thousands of times quicker and more precise than man can do, a machine that can learn on and on, from increasingly storage data, a machine that using all the above, it’s able to take decisions and act appropriately from its own.  
No doubt that this sounds frightening and it sure seems like a huge threat to humankind. Especially because we are thinking of a nonhuman kind, much more powerful than humans,(""physically"" and mentally) that can control our life in many possible ways.
But let us think our shelfs inside an autonomous car, that it’s about to crash with another car coming from the opposite direction. Our car has two choices, stop and crashes with lower speed, or turn and hits the pavement. And it makes thousands of calculations in milli seconds, combines similar accidents that are storage in the CPU and finally acts appropriately, taking the right decision and saves our life. This scenario sounds no frightening at all. Our feelings are much closer to a relief than to a threat. 
 So the main issue here is in “act appropriately”. Or in a most accurate way is in, who has the control of the machine’s or agents’ actions. And not only who, but also on what principles.They are not simple questions to be answered, but the real threat here is to avoid the questions. Questions and issues will raise perpetually as AI goes on.  We have to not ignore them, but work hard in a global level to give the right answers 
After all, it seems like the eternal questioning about whether science has to makes progress, regardless of it serves the humankind or not. But in our case AI is build to serve the humankind or at least it has to.",Nikolasskordelis,,skoraris@yahoo.gr,Rogerio Shieh Barbosa,admin,rs3795@columbia.edu,CSMM101,105/discussion/1820,verified,audit

Most of the alarming scenarios I’ve read refer to “Strong AI” or Artificial Consciousness – a computer-hosted human-like but much more powerful mind that controls our environment, weapons, power grid, and the like.  HAL 9000 decided to kill its crew, Skynet nuked the world so that the machines could take over, etc.  We are perhaps fortunate that the cognitive / “machines with minds” approach has been largely abandoned by mainstream AI.  Research does continue, however, and a breakthrough is possible at any time.



We certainly should be concerned.  



We should equally be concerned about black holes being formed by particle accelerators, the creation of antimatter, and similar potential side effects of both practical and theoretical advances across science and technology. That doesn’t mean that we should stop research, but that we should be thoughtful and careful.  Science fiction authors can serve a beneficial function by postulating adverse effects and doomsday scenarios which we can then strive to avoid.



What’s much more likely, in the near term, are AIs designed and trained to conduct criminal or terrorist actions.  We see their results in many of the reported cases of data breaches, and its certain that someone is planning to attempt to hack into an oil pipeline management, power distribution, weapons control, or other potentially dangerous existing system in advance of terror objectives.  Undermining faith in our government or its process is another current issue – Russian interference in our elections, for example, almost certainly involved at least some machine learning.

At this moment not too much concerned (my case) because we are in the begin of this new concept. Yes it's true that exist many automate systems can help humans to performance many things and make our lifes better. Behind all this and for this moment and this era is the human hand with good and bad intentions. The good point is that the automate system can't change or evolve constantly because was build in a base, for example a comun programming language  in a determinate framework or platform. Change this root and the system will go down. I don't know how many years have to pass to see a real automate system that can browse in whichever device available in the world and evolve to converge in any of it to manipulate his assembler structure.

It is coded in our dna. Who can mate, who survives, who can eat who. Several mechanisms are at work here, but they all end up in feeling good or feeling bad. Like Turing stated in his essay that for learning to be effective it might involve rewarding and punishing, this way learning is executed is a translation of this feel good - feel bad principle. Even learning by experimenting leads to success and failure which translates to feeling good or feeling bad. Giving up is just another way of experimenting. 
Typical mechanisms that influence feelings that I can think of right now are power, possession (eg money), survival and reproduction. And if these mechanisms are somehow shared by AI it is very likely that the reward, to be the predominant one, will evolve to be destructive.

But let's make sure that this cannot happen and agree that AI has no feelings.



Another issue that already proofed itself is that of mis-training. The information we use for AI to learn will always be limited. The real world is more complex and is less predictable then the lab version. 
And the way AI responds might look great in a controlled environment but it can be mis-trained, like AI that recognized the drapes that were actually recognized by finding a bed first or diversity exclusion in recruitment because in the past only men applied and were selected for certain post.

Not understanding what the AI is doing and limit its information could lead to misinformed learning. This might go ok for a long time. If this AI is training a improved version of itself then an evolution is set in motion with some critical problems in there we don't understand and cannot repair. And also the real world is more complex than that we taught the ai. It becomes luck that nothing goes terribly wrong. 

So is AI a threat? Yes absolutely, it will control and decide for us. It will probably outperform us in many ways. But that is also what makes it very useful. It will help us out in ways we can't do ourselves. 

Therefor the ethics, governing and securing, and transparency that gives us the possibility to inspect and adapt AI are key aspects in the field of evolving AI.

I didn’t grow up with the terminology of AI but robots, killing machines trying to destroy humanity, so for a different prospective from a different generation, I turned to my 13-year-old for her opinion on AI.

Maybe I’m not academic enough but I found it incredibly hard to read (compared to all the other chapters and articles recommended). I felt the closest that made sense to me was the bit that was not agreed on by Searle that “… no neuron in my brain understands English, although my whole brain does.”. I feel that understanding  a language and speaking a language are both functions for a computer, but the assessment and understanding of what is said to and spoken by the computer/robot is much more complex. I feel that at present we’re still far from getting to that high level with AI, but will with time. I do feel though that this non-stop discussing about this one example and statement from Searle brings up Einstein’s statement: ""Problems cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them.” I do feel that harping on this one thing is delaying the whole process of us simply achieving it. 

As regards the threat of AI, I do feel that, other than those programmed to harm, what will be the deciding factor of whether AI will be dangerous or not in the long run (talking now regarding the General AI or Strong AI) is its frame of reference. If it uses systems thinking, humans (as well as animals and the environment) would be part of the system and its objective would be for the whole system (including humans) rather than against humans.

This is why people can still be able to pickup information from broken sentences.

Having said that, the question that can be posed is whether AI can model the 'circuit' properly or not. To create a general artificial intelligence model means to design a system that can adapt to many conditions and produce a fair result even though it doesn't get enough information.

We've been enjoying reading your responses! It is great that you are thinking about issues around AI and by the end of the course I think you will have a better idea of what AI can and cannot do. 

It seems to me that many have expressed concern about AI. While I think there indeed are things to be concerned about (we do not want machines that harm people!), I think it is important to keep in mind that machines have a very particular way of ""thinking"", which is very different from humans.

I will give an example with music. which I studied for many years. I can guarantee that a machine cannot compose or understand music like a human does, because even though a machine can be trained (through machine learning), it needs to be told what the goal is, which is simply not possible with something as subjective as music. However, that does not make it impossible to build applications that pass the Turing Test with music. MuseNet and BachBot are two examples. Nevertheless, the process through which the machine arrives at a goal is different than humans, and by the end of the course you should be more familiar how this happens.",Rogerio Shieh Barbosa,admin,rs3795@columbia.edu,Rogerio Shieh Barbosa,admin,rs3795@columbia.edu,CSMM101,105/discussion/1820,audit,audit

Maybe one of the most sensitive areas is what will be the priorities of an autonomous car.

If the vehicle had to choose, what the criteria would be? That’s a hard question and there are no easy answers of course.  


In order  to  autonomous driving be part of our daily life it will take to : 
1)    Redefine a law system that includes autonomous vehicles.
•    What are the rules?
•    What will happen with the insurance companies and contracts? For example
    - What happens if an autonomous vehicle involves in an accident with a human      driving vehicle? 
    - What happens in case that the accident caused as a result of autonomous vehicle’s bad programming.
•    People will have to accept the use of these vehicles. Will the use of that kind of vehicles become obligatory  or not?
•    Will the passenger have the choice of taking the control and in what cases? For example will autonomous cars have systems to detect alcohol and not allow human driving?
•    What about public transportation?
 
2)    Redefine the streets and roads with
•    Placing sensors and other necessary equipment 
•    Maybe redefine traffic lanes
•    Signals that permits pedestrians to understand the movement of autonomous cars.

3)    In research level, from technical aspect, the automotive sector is ready in many fields. Of course, as everything that has to do with technology there are so much to be done.

Intelligence must be distributed across several agents dispatched in the near and far environment, each one dedicated to performing a dedicated, maybe simplified task sub-task. This architecture would provide a more robust framework for artificial decision-making, and extend the range of environment parameters to be taken into account when taking that decision.

Agents would then be other autonomous vehicles, manned vehicles (including regular bikes, scooters, and so on), smart city monitoring devices, road and weather status reporting and alert services, etc

As for the embedded AI within the vehicle itself, it would then integrate other agents' real-time data to create a sense of anticipation, react to the vehicle's sensors for immediate alert, and monitor the vehicle functions and state of health.

Autonomous driving can fully become part of our daily life when supporting infrastructures are ready (smart city agents and ultra-fast wireless networking being a requirement) ; civil laws should be updated to provide a solid legal background to autonomous road usage ; responsibilities hierarchy should be re-thought; road and street users should be educated in accordance to the new lifestyle being created.

When will this happen? Some of it is happening already. Smart cities should bring the first relevant infrastructures within 5 to 10 years. Networking solutions should be here in a 3 to 5 years time.

Real-time visual processing could be replaced with technologies that include transponders in every vehicle, so that each vehicle could be aware of all other vehicles’ positions, destinations, current route plans, velocity, and numerous other factors.  GPS, if not improved, could still provide additional but less accurate positional information.  RADAR would seem to be necessary for collision avoidance, detection of any case where a vehicle deviated from its plan, etc.  This would involve large quantities of real time data via multiple streams that would need to be processed continually.


The involved AI technologies would include informed search for determining initially optimal routes, but it seems that adversarial search would also be necessary to address the planned and instant behaviors of other vehicles.



We can further assume that any necessary training of the vehicles would need to have occurred before they were sold to their initial users – successful self-operation on first use would be mandatory.  That doesn’t mean that they should not improve over time.  Each vehicle could presumably be operated on a limited set of roads and to a limited set of destinations in most cases, and should therefore be able to learn to behave optimally under local conditions and use patterns.  These assumptions would imply the need for factory supervised and unsupervised learning – probably a standard training baseline for all vehicles of each various class – and the ability to apply reinforcement learning as it is used.



The assumed roadway technology preparation would be very expensive, especially if we assume universality.  I would guess that cost will be a significant barrier to real adoption of self-driving vehicles.  Taxpayers would have to fund both the infrastructure and their vehicles, abandon their current non-intelligent vehicles, and elect officials who are willing to ask the taxpayers to bear these burdens.  Limiting scope to a small set of specific roads and perhaps to commercial self-driving traffic only would be a more palatable first step.  Universal adoption is, I fear, a long way off simply because of money.



The more control we have over the environment, the smaller any technology gaps would be.  A single road, limited to self-driving vehicles only, is technologically viable now as are the vehicles to use them.  While research would continue, nearly no additional research is necessary to make self-driving vehicles under very controlled conditions a current reality.  Wider adoption would probably be much more difficult to realize because of human reticence and cost.

The car now is a big device. I just want to tell a short but nutritive summary. The AI like every live being counts with senses. For this example the AI need 'see' the environment and whichever thing aroud of it. How? Simple using 'eyes' like a camera which is it a very bad idea, of course now because the time to respond for an action is limited and we knows that the image processing is a heavy process for a machine. Other is use internet or web connection because you can know by gps if you are very close to the next car and if the path is clear and many things you can find by the internet. But for a stable internet connection with need a very good access point. In a city this is not a big problem because first the connection is good and the car speed it's not as fast as if your in the freeway. Without count tunnels and atmospheric interference. For me the best idea is connect all the cars by a 'local way' connection which all the cars with be connect in line, passing the information to car to car also using a middle connector device different of the car but thanks to this stabilizing the connection, making better it by being an access point. If the car is far from another car the device will aproach the signal to the next car and will make better the connection.

The Driver would be an agent that receives the destination from the user and then -
- plots the optimal course and adjusts it based on data analysis, e.g., traffic
- navigates through the streets/terrain while taking into consideration the relevant traffic rules
This would require pretty much all traditional AI components, from computer vision to machine learning, as we want the autonomous to get better over time and learn from, say, near-misses. Those components are already in place by and large.

The Ethicist will cope with issues of preference in terms of the interests of the human user versus the rest of factors: traffic rules, other autonomous and regular cars, etc.  In the case when there the choice is between hurting its user or another car, what should the AI choose? What about the Trolley Dilemma, when the choice is between one life vs. multiple lives?

I don't think it will take a lot in terms of the traffic infrastructure to accommodate autonomous cars - after all, they are already here, and the roads in most places where these marvels are likely to show up are rather well organized: are uniform in terms of traffic signs, etc. There is, however, another important aspect - the legal infrastructure, and particularly the question of responsibility. Who will be responsible for car's ""misbehavior"" - the manufacturer, the user, nobody? How to proceed in cases of the car hurting somebody in order to accommodate its user?

I don't believe the autonomous vehicles will replace the human-controlled ones in the foreseeable future, excepting special cases like trucks. One or two high-profile cases of such cars hurting humans, or a successful hacking of a fleet of autonomous vehicles, are likely to have the same effect the Hindenburg disaster had on the airship travel. What we need for solutions like autonomous cars to take hold is a change of the cultural paradigm, specifically in our approach to risk and individual interest.

Weather data such as temperature, rain, storm, fog but especially information about the road conditions and surroundings are necessary, also the acoustic signal of a siren from police, ambulance or fire brigade must be recognized. 
Information from road maps, route planners and traffic guidance systems leads to an AI decision search. The vehicles will be networked with each other, but there will always be road users who do not actively provide any data (pedestrians, animals). 

Autonomous driving will only gain social acceptance if the risk of accidents is significantly lower than that of human drivers. Here we are still a long way away. In road traffic, events can occur that the software developers did not model and that did not occur during machine learning. For a possible example, please think of a overturned tank truck transporting either soft soap or super glue. The leaking liquid can have two different consequences: 1. The following vehicles stop earlier because the adhesive additionally brakes and there is a mass collision. 2. The following vehicles lose grip, get off the road and crash down the cliff at the edge of the road. After the consternation about the catastrophe, the question of liability arises.

The skeleton code consists of the set of files that should already be on Vocareum when you launch your project. You will work only on Player_AI.py, which for now just contains a function that returns a random move. Your job is to implement your own getMove() (and any necessary helper functions) using the specifications from the prompt.

As expectiminimax seems the natural choice for this game, I was wondering if this was just for practice's sake, or if there was another reason why this might be the case.

The strongest case for minimax I can think of is that it never underestimates opponent utility, so even if playing against a subpar/random enemy, minimax will always yield a move that is at least as good as one made against a perfect enemy. But while expectiminimax naturally comes with the opportunity, given a bit of bad luck, for nonideal plies, I would assume that minimax could be overly cautious, and would lead to an overly narrow view of the search space.",Archopin,,safvt93@gmail.com,,,,CSMM101,105/discussion/2137,verified,

We have received many questions about whether you could take four courses at once to earn the MicroMasters degree.

The answer is yes, but a few things to keep in mind:



A workload consisting of four courses is the same as a full-time student, so you would need to budget your time accordingly.

The time you need to dedicate weekly for each course will depend on your previous knowledge on programming, calculus, linear algebra, and probability. Please refer below for the prerequisites for each course.

Although you could take all courses at once, there is a natural progression in the MicroMasters courses: AI goes well with ML, Robotics with Animation.

For students who are eager to complete the MicroMasters, we recommend you to take a combination of AI and ML in one session and Robotics and Animation and CGI in another because AI introduces some concepts that will be featured in ML while Robotic tends to have a lighter course load compared to the heavy course load in Animation and CGI, which serves as a great complement. Each course is offered twice a year, once in the Fall (Sep-Dec) and once in the Spring (Feb-May).

Here is a breakdown of prerequisites for each course:



AI: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, derivatives), Calculus, Basic probability theory, Python programming

ML: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, derivatives), Calculus, Basic probability theory, Python programming

Robotics: Linear algebra, Knowledge of Linux environment, Python

Animation and CGI:  Multi-variable calculus, linear algebra, C++, knowledge to navigate a large codebase

No matter which study path you choose, rest assured that there will be plenty of learning materials and your course staff and classmates will be very willing to help!",Rogerio Shieh Barbosa,admin,rs3795@columbia.edu,,,,CSMM101,105/discussion/2573,audit,

It is exciting to learn that you are interested in applying to Columbia University CS masters program. To your question, the simple answer is that you need to completed the entire AI MicroMasters program upon your application to be considered waiving the 7.5 credits. Although, MicroMasters will be a good addition in your portfolio but it is not necessary to have for your application. If you are able to get in a semester or a year, that means you will graduate and ready for the job market earlier. 

Many of the on-campus CU students would also take ColumbiaX MicroMasters courses to review the content or expand the topics regarding AI and ML etc. If you'd like to continue this conversation, I'd be happy to assist you off line. Just let me know. Thank you.

In the lecture notes regarding DFS, the notes p14 and the pseudo code on p15 show Fringe Nodes B and C being added to the stack.  With this description it would that mean the Last (of LIFO) would be C and not as described B.

I am trying to debug my dfs_search algorithm code, but I am at a standstill. My bfs_search algorithm is working fine, but dfs_search seems to run indefinitely even for the simplest cases (e.g. initial state = 1,0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8).

I've used an OrderedDict to store the frontier and a set to hold the explored nodes. 

frontier = OrderedDict()

explored = set()

These are the only difference between my bfs_search and dfs_search: 

bfs_search uses the default skeleton code for PuzzleState (child nodes are added in the order of UDLR). I then use frontier.popitem(last = False) to explore nodes FIFO

dfs_search is almost the same, except that within the expand function of the skeleton code, child nodes are added in the order of RLDU. I then use frontier.popitem(last = True) to explore nodes LIFO.

I think I need to do more reading on data structures! But if I understand your comment correctly, I am using hashable values to store keys (please let me know if I misunderstood)

For the frontier (type OrderDict) I use PuzzleState.config (type tuple) as the key, and the corresponding PuzzleState object as the value. 

As I explore the frontier, I add these key/value pairs into the explored set. 

When I do membership checks in explored or frontier, I check to see if that PuzzleState.config is already in explored or frontier. I believe this is equivalent to checking whether a particular tuple/board layout is already in these data sets. I don't check for membership based on PuzzleState objects.

This method works for bfs_search. 

As far as I can tell, changing  frontier.popitem(last = False) to  frontier.popitem(last = True) is the thing that makes dfs_search fail.",Dtyr,,dtyrpak@g.clemson.edu,Archopin,,safvt93@gmail.com,CSMM101,105/discussion/2725,verified,verified

For checking for membership in explored, I would recommend having explored as a set of tuples that stores the configs, that way you are able to check for membership with ease. 

Storing the puzzle state object in the dict you are using isn't going to lead to the correct solution because you can have 2 objects with the same config but they were generated from different parents and as such the objects themselves are different the same even though the configs are the same.

There were two issues

1) Storing PuzzleState.config AND corresponding PuzzleState objects in the explored set was making the code run indefinitely. Changing the code so that I only stored the PuzzleState.config tuples made the dfs code find a solution. However, the cost returned was incorrect. I had to make one more change.

2) The final fix was to simply reverse the neighbors list inside the dfs_search code block (so that the nodes would be added in order RLDU) instead of defining  a new DFS PuzzleState class that added nodes in order of RLDU. Not sure why the two approaches aren't equivalent, but creating a separate class just to add the nodes in reverse order did seem kind of sloppy and redundant.",Dtyr,,dtyrpak@g.clemson.edu,Sfullmer,,stu.fullmer@gmail.com,CSMM101,105/discussion/2725,verified,verified

Have you tried it on the Vocareum? If it's still slow you likely have an algorithm issue. As Rogerio mentioned it's probably how you are accessing the data structures. This occurs in at least three ways from the examples. 1. Adding elements 2. Removing elements and 3. Checking for the existence of an element. For Lifo / Fifo adding and removing is very quick. That's probably the frontier right? Searching for a match in the Lifo / Fifo list is an O(n) vs an O(1) if you used a different structure. What data structure are you using for the explored elements? You will have to at least add new elements and check for matches in the explored set.

    And how are you comparing elements? Are you comparing just the states (what the board looks like) or the whole structure? The whole structure could involve matching against all the parent or children nodes. This would blow up exponentially.

    Also if you're creating large amounts of memory you could be thrashing and this can also add lots of time (depends on many factors though). To check for memory let us know what you see from ru_maxrss resource. Don't forget to divide by 1024 to convert from Kilobytes to Megabytes. Cheers.

I have some queries regarding the implementation details of BFS and DFS. 

1. The instruction says to make explicit use of queue and stack as frontier. Does this mean we have to define our own stack and queue classes? Or can we directly use list as stack and collections.deque for queue?

2. Can we use a single set to represent explored_union_frontier nodes or should we make two different data structures as told in the algorithm and check membership separately? 

3. Should we do exactly as in the algorithm or can we make changes as long as they do not affect the final outputs and we follow the remove, check and expand order?

4. Probably this question is a little out of the context but, is defining depth and  cost as attributes of a state a good idea in terms of re-usability?

1. Mathematics (linear algebra, probability calculus, formal logic)

2. Python programming experience 

3. Undisturbed 8-10 hours in which you can fully concentrate on the content.

4. advanced English skills (Google translator alone is not enough, fine details in meaning and even incorrect translations are not noticed.) 

5. Fully functional PC with error-free Python environment and Internet.

I concur with what you have said. For all your points noted I am proficient in all except (1), where I have sufficient knowledge for week 1-4.  Despite this, I have found to achieve top marks (which is my target for a Masters course), weeks 1-2 took 15hrs each, week 3, 30 hrs and week 4, nearing 40-50 hrs and not finished.  

Week 4 is excessive as the heuristics that are required to get a basic pass [512, 512, 512, 512, 512] is not as obvious as it seems.  The solution is compounded by the fact the course material specifically states to consider weights including log2 weighting to get a suitable utility for a move. 

I am at a point where I have had to  write additional code to run ongoing optimisation of the four  (of five or so) separate heuristics that I have discovered by research and still need further work to write code for the fifth to get the basic grade.  Yes, I will get there in the end, but never in my wildest imagination could I get it done in 8-10 hrs per week.

I have just resigned myself, for this subject, I have to close down all other personal activities (outside a full time job) to get through the material to the standard I have set myself.  It will make me re-consider the rest of the micro-master as an introduction to a Masters degree at the end of this subject.

Thanks for the feedback, because I'm no exception, if I was wrong with the estimated time spent. I reach my limit sooner to invest more time, After work, a maximum of 3 hours are possible, as the concentration decreases, at the weekend would be more possible, but you also need some rest and private activities.

I think I get an idea of the timing from what you have said.



1hr lectures

3-4 hrs reading

4-5 hrs for quiz/assignments

As it's been decades since I was an engineering graduate I am finding that the reading is taking longer, and as I am being double attentive to my quiz and assignment questions, these times are doubling as well.

Overall, it's not an issue; I just need to mentally plan for the time so I don't get behind in any week.

Firstly, I undertook the course as a lead into a Masters Degree.  I do not just want to passing grade, but truly want to learn the material, and hopefully use it as a gateway to a PhD one day.

Secondly, It's been decades since I undertook separate Engineer and Business undergradute degrees, but in that period I have become a Subject Matter Expert in the technical fields I work in, and technically respected both domestically and internationally.

Now to the key point. 

I believe the description of the course of 8-10 hrs per week is blatantly wrong unless you possibly have studied this material before,  have recent experience in learning methodologies and a student who can apply and remember the details at first encounter.  So for most students this is not the case so it should be pointed out  that these estimates are minimal and should be extended to two to three times for the average student.  This should be pointed out before the student commits to this material.

My case is I want to learn and understand this material.  Seeking 100% on all quizes, assignment and if possible in the proctored exam is the measurement on my success.

For an hour of video I usually expended at least three times the video duration by-reviewing ambiguity or new concepts, researching and learning unknown associated detail being presented, taking notes and reviewing all notes both immediately after and multiple times after to reinforce learning.

For the reading, I take about 2-3 minutes per page at best for a maximum of 15 minutes at a time.  There are recommendations such as:

Recommended Reading

4. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd Edition Russell & Norvig, Chapter 18.


... where this is about 65 pages, that I do not see how this is possible to complete this reading and understand this in one week let alone a few hours allocated...

For the assignment, again the estimate is inadequate.  An example is Assignment 2. it is know that Assignment 2 is open ended.  Other than a paragraph or two, there was no information presented on the approach to maximize learning.  I ended up writing 600 or so lines of python to include:



The minmax algorithm

10 or so heuristics

test code to test the heuristics basic functions

code to test the heuristics in combinations

code to test and vary the weights of the heuristics

code to test the heuristics give various combinations, weights 

I got to where I wanted to be and I understand the effects of weights and the impact of the state of the problem has w.r.t weights.  Time expended was over 100 hours.

I do maintain a highly technical full time position so finding the time to allocate to this has meant literally dropping everything else from my life.  This is not what was expected when the advised effort was 8-10 hrs per week.

At this point, I do not believe I can continue with the rest of the Micro Master subjects in the format presented over 12 weeks.  At the moment I am considering two or three sequential enrollments per subjects to allow me to learn at my own rate.  This means I can spend 2-3 times the duration to understand the details. Only after having pre-learned the material may I consider enrolling and paying for the verified track of that subject.

To end this, I do want to say thank you for the opportunity.  It is an exciting field and I hope may people can achieve what I find myself time poor in.

I'm afraid this is not exactly all. My first choice was one of the two first algorithms (I don't remember which one). The system granted me a 5/10, which led me to make a second attempt ; I therefore selected the two algorithms. Then my grade dropped to 2.5/10 and as I asked for the answer, ""none"" was selected.

The grader looks at each option to see if it is correctly selected or not. So your initial grade was 5 because even when you selected just one (wrong) algorithm, two answers would have the correctly left unselected. So for instance, suppose you selected option 1:



Option 1: correct = not marked. Student = marked. WRONG

Option 2: correct = not marked. Student = not marked. CORRECT

Option 3: correct = not marked. Student = not marked. CORRECT

Option 4: correct = marked. Student = not marked. WRONG

Thus in this scenario you get 5/10 points. Since you selected the two algorithms for the second attempt, one less option would be correct, so you got 2.5/10.

Here are some key takeaways I had from week 1.

Quick Summary:


My key takeaways from Week 1 is that AI is influenced by a variety of fields including:

    1. Philosophy

    2. Mathematics

    3. Economics

    4. Neuroscience

    5. Psychology

    6. Computer Engineering

    7. Control theory and cybernetics

    8. Linguistics



AI is study and design of intelligent agents, where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success.  AI also falls under 4 schools of thought:

    1. Thinking Humanly

    2. Acting Humanly

    3. Thinking Rationally

    4. Acting Rationally



Broad Categories of Application of AI:

    i. NLP 

    ii. Recommender Systems

    iii. Computer Vision

    iv. Robotics

    v. Adversial Search

    vi. Etc.



Longer Summary:



We discussed and interpreted some of the challenges that we face with AI.  Not just from a building and history perspective but potential future states as well.  The history of AI was initially optimistic, followed a brief period of reduced funding for research, and is now presently exploding.  



Initially there was a lot of early optimism with the potential for AI but was followed by a brief period of reduced funding.  However, recently with all the technical advances, it seems like the demand for AI is exploding.  As such, much of the readings revolved around how to understand AI and the potential advantages as well as detriments it can pose.  ""Is Artificial Intelligence Permanently Inscrutable? (Aaron M. Bornstein)"" describes how difficult it is to understand.  Explain too much and AI is not human-interpretable, and falls victim to quirks in the data as it is primarily used for pattern recognition.  Over explain and you become inundated with too much data and its insights become unactionable.  



The document ""Preparing For the Future of Artificial Intelligence"" dives into how it can be an excellent economic and social driver but it has to be closely monitored and be done deliberately to avoid the potential pitfalls.  Pitfalls include but are not limited to economic inequality, law and ethics ambiguity, and development of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS).  It seems that there should be special considerations while building intelligent agents to do so deliberately and with good intent.

I look forward to reading everyone else's thoughts and please correct me if I have misconstrued or misrepresented any of the aforementioned information!",Pxlam15,,pxlam15@gmail.com,Susan,admin,xc2496@tc.columbia.edu,CSMM101,105/discussion/3332,verified,audit

We will be posting our own key takeaways to encourage participation. It is important to share and engage with others, even if you are shy! You do not need to write anything fancy, but just revisiting the material will help you learn better. Here's my attempt:



What stood out the most to me: The list of AI applications is enormous, we can basically say AI can be applied to anything. I had never thought of AI for energy optimization for instance. There is a common thread among all of them which is automation and necessity for large amounts of data. 

1) Four schools of thought



Thinking humanly



problem: we don’t necessarily know how we think, so how can we recreate out thought process?



Thinking rationally



problem: not all ideas can be expressed through logic. 



Acting humanly:



Turing test. Doesn't seem feasible for everything.



Acting rationally: 



Our approach. It tries to get the best outcome given some data.

2) Applications of AI examples: spam classification, machine translation, and many more

3) Overview of course:



a) Intelligent agents
- program searches a goal through actions (hence “intelligent”)
b) Machine learning
- program gets better with experience
c) Applications of AI
-  NLP, computer vision, robotics, etc.",Rogerio Shieh Barbosa,admin,rs3795@columbia.edu,Susan,admin,xc2496@tc.columbia.edu,CSMM101,105/discussion/3332,audit,audit

I interpret g(n) as being the Manhattan distance from the current state/configuration to the next state/configuration, and h(n) as being the Manhattan distance from that state to the goal state (where the configuration is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 )


So if I'm at A and I want to go to C, but I have to go through B first. The total cost is ManhattanDistance(A,B) + ManahattanDistance(B,C)",Dtyr,,dtyrpak@g.clemson.edu,Sfullmer,,stu.fullmer@gmail.com,CSMM101,105/discussion/3394,verified,verified

The slides can use some clarification on that point. The video lecture however, clarifies this point. g(n) is the actual cost. h(n) is the estimated cost to the goal, not the next node.

I'm curious as to how well your A* solves the problem. Does it give the same optimal path in all 3 sample cases provided? Do you get full credit when submitting your assignment? It's not that what you have couldn't work (especially for this simple assignment which is symmetric in most ways), but for more complicated and high dimensional problems I think you're going to end up with subtle issues that could be very hard to figure out.

Also, in your example you are calculating the MD between the states and there's no point in that. You have the actual cost between the nodes already! So I assuming you meant MD(A,C) and MD(B,C).

By your example, if there's a more costly move from A directly to C, by adding the estimated costs twice, you'll end up overestimating the path through B->C. And your algorithm could pick A->C which is more costly and non-optimal. If you think about it, you're breaking the admissibility of the algorithm as detailed further on in the lectures (video + notes). h*(n) is supposed to be the true cost. Therefore, g(n) is the actual cost to that node. This can be inferred by our use of g(n) in the previous algorithms. The other hint is that if you set h(n) == 0, you end up with UCS.

The second thing that could also be causing an overestimation: Do not calculate the distance of the blank tile as part of the MD.",Sfullmer,,stu.fullmer@gmail.com,Dtyr,,dtyrpak@g.clemson.edu,CSMM101,105/discussion/3394,verified,verified

The pseudo-code provides for an action: if neighbor not in frontier U explored but make no reference to any action if goal-state in frontier which the point in the Q&A is making.  In the Q&A it states:

..... since the goal state is already pushed into frontier (i.e. the state corresponding to ['Up', 'Left', 'Left'] move), any subsequent encounter to the solution state cannot execute frontier.push() or goalTest() and is effectively meaningless.

My interpretation is the pseudo code needs to take this into account.  If my interpretation is valid, then the pseudo-code is incomplete, and the reason for my query.

On vocareum, you are able to test your code as you work since you are allowed multiple submissions(so if you don't get a perfect score you can check the results and see what test your program is failing) and the terminal on there prints out error messages if you run into any errors. You can also just type up your code locally on IDLE and then upload to vocareum when you want to submit. 

You will submit a single .py file that has all the required functions, so you will define each function on its own withing the same driver.py file

There is a limit when it comes to wait time between submissions so that you don't submit too many times within a relatively short interval.

It'll find the same solution. Where IDS differs is how much memory is required to be stored to look for the new nodes. BFS keeps track of a whole frontier of nodes approximately the same depth (they usually differ by 1).  So at depth 12 of tree with 2 branches per layer is 2^12.

    DFS keeps track of the path up to the node its searching and therefore requires many fewer nodes in the frontier.

Minor Bug: Using the PlayerAI as provided in the assignments may result in a KeyType exception if the player has no moves left. This is very unlikely to occur, but experimenting can cause this somewhat easily. I find early exit is useful to collect data during experiments or when the agent behaves in a way that it shouldn't have and I want to print a bunch of stuff and stop the ride. Moving the code in the file GameManager.py at line 74 ""print(actionDic[move])"" to after the validation check on line 77 fixes this error.



2. Needs Clarification: In the assignment notes all files are referred to as (FileName)_3.py, but all the files on Vocareum are just (FileName).py. The downloadable code (Week 4 Assignment Skeleton Code) has both versions of (FileName)_3.py, and (FileName).py which is also confusing. I've decided to use the (FileName)_3.py file set and name my work file PlayerAI_3.py for local work. But on Vocareum I'll try submitting as PlayerAI.py.

1) Agents
- perceive (through sensors)
- act upon what was observed
(Perceive, think, act)

2) Environment types
- Observable (yes/partially/no)
- Agents (single vs. multi)
- Deterministic (yes/no, i.E. when an action )
- Static (yes/semi/dynamic)
- Discrete (vs. continuos)

3) State vs Search Space
- State space is physical while the search space is a abstract idea 
- Search space regions: Explored, Frontier (to be visited), Unexplored.
- Search tree: parents originated children through actions

4) Uninformed search
- BFS: goes in order of depth
    Time: O (b^d )
    Space: O(b^d)
    Complete and optimal
- DFS: deepest first
    Time: O (b^m )
    Space: O(bm)
    Complete ONLY IN FINITE spaces and not optimal
- Depth-limited and Iterative Deepening:
    Modifications of the DFS (depth limit restricts the max depth, iterative progressively increases the max depth)
- Uniform cost search
    Prioritizes by cost (distance for example), not by depth

Implementation: BFS: queue, DFS: stack, UCS: priority queue

What stood out to me the most: 
Even though search problems are conceptually simple, they are powerful because they can solve many problems (at least through a brute-force approach). A human approaches the same problem very differently than a machine: using the shortest path problem as an example, the machine seems to take unnecessary steps, while a human would do the process in fewer steps. However, a machine creates and examines these states faster, so it can afford to create a search tree and examine it.",Rogerio Shieh Barbosa,admin,rs3795@columbia.edu,Rogerio Shieh Barbosa,admin,rs3795@columbia.edu,CSMM101,105/discussion/4682,audit,audit

So the instructional team compiled a list of suggestions on getting started as well as common questions we got from students in the last run of the class:



Go over the lecture materials (informed search and uninformed search) for the related assignment

Follow the pseudocode provided by the instructor in lecture material above and try implementing it line by line

If you run into any problems or have questions, check the FAQs for the assignment to see if you get any helpful information from that.

If the FAQs don't seem to provide you with solutions, check the discussion forum and see if a question similar to yours has been asked before and look at how those discussions went about that problem

If that still doesn't shed light on what to do next, post a question on the forum pointing out the specific areas you are having difficulty with and the course staff would be happy to assist you



Commonly asked starter questions about project 1

When is a node expanded:  The concept of nodes expanded means, how many nodes' children did you generate while searching for a solution. A node is considered expanded when it has been popped from the frontier

What is the goal state for this assignment?: the goal state you are looking for would be the solved puzzle: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 

Is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,0 a goal state?: No. We only have 1 goal state.

Why is the number of nodes expanded in A* different from the one in the HW example?:  The number varies based on how you implement tie-breaking for nodes that have the same priority in the queue. You are allowed to have a different number of nodes expanded.

What should I add to the noded expanded set: Add an immutable representation of puzzl.config(either a tuple or a string).  If you just store a puzzle state object in the explored set, no other object will be similar to it in python. So 2 puzzle state objects might have the same config, but because python compares objects by reference, when comparing objects for equality, it'll check if the 2 objects are stored in the same address in memory, but they aren't stored in the same place because they were generated from different parents and at different times. If you add objects to the explored set, then your code will run for too long and return the wrong result.

If you look at the getAvaliableMoves method you can see that is append the move whenever it is available.  So, it can return [0] (only up move is available or [1, 2, 3](up move is not available but all other moves are. So, when you return move[0] technically you can return move that is not 0 (up move). 

This is the direction variable:

I think i figure it out, but i can't get how i can handle the children of the grid. I mean lets suppose that the available moves are UP and DOWN. So we are going to have two possible children, child(UP) and child(DOWN). How can we actually handle them? Lets say i want to run the command 

if child(UP)... something :

    print(child(UP)) or list.append(child(UP))

Sorry to see you leave but we totally understand you have other priorities. 

Let me break down your question and explain for you:

1. Yes, you can enroll the course as many times you want. 

2. To enroll for the verified track, you have to pay in each course.

3. There's a chance for you to get refund within a certain condition. Please see this link. 

4. Your future record wouldn't over-ride the past (the current one) but all edX certificates doesn't show the grades. 

5. This course, is like many other MOOCs, is mastery based. Due to different backgrounds and resources (i.e. study time), there are quite a number of learners who enroll more than one time complete the course. 

At last, we also suggest you save your code and try to do as much as possible in this cohort. That will also help you get through the course in the future run. Please let us know if you have any questions. Thank you.

The reverse lexicographical ordering  is just a convention that we use for the dfs search. So, in real situation you can use lexicographical or just the order that is was insert it.

First I implemented the minimax and added the AB pruning on top of that. For most of the project I simply scored every empty tile as my starting heuristic. For maximum (Player's move) I would test each available move and for minimum (Computer's move) I would pick 4 random moves. I used a depth of 3-5 where 1 level includes both min and max evals. This was too slow and not good enough but it got me to 1024 frequently and allowed me to test that I implemented the pruning and minimax correctly.

To fix the problem with the speed you need to consider two things. Firstly: The opening of the game has the most potential moves with similar scores. This can eat up a lot of the algorithms time in the first few moves of the game. To get better pruning I ""borrowed"" the technique from the 2048 online game linked in the assignment notes. During the minimize, they put a 2 and a 4 in every tile and scored it. The ones with the 'meanest' scores are selected for maximizing and the totals are then minimized and passed upwards. That keeps the minimize search from becoming HUGE!  Second: But how to know when to stop searching? Or to put another way, how deep to look? Think back to assignment 1 and DFS, because minimax is similar to DFS. I don't want to spoil by just saying what the answer is, but it's very simple (at least in thought, code may be different). With that change I was searching 4-5 levels on average but toward the end as the board simplified I was seeing depth searches in the hundreds.

Finally the heuristics needed to be improved to reach the 2048s. I found the 0 counting and adding an implementation of monotonicity to be very important to achieving those results. I found studying the heuristics from the 2048 online game to be extremely helpful.

If you've played the game yourself, you may have found that keeping the higher scores against the side or corner of the board is very effective. If you implement monotonicity correctly, the AI will exhibit this behavior as well.

Until I was ready to submit I used a lot of debug code. I would print the scores from the heuristic functions and the depth and time the player was taking on every move. I would also modify the board passed into the player so that I could examine specific sequences and the players reaction. I found a bug that taught me how to make python 2 dim arrays correctly. You can use the if __name__ == '__main__' in the player to execute tests on that module and therefor look for bugs.

I hope these hints help. Cheers,

First of all thank your for your reply!

Are your first and second point important for achieve the 2048 or are they purely optimization related ? Of course as better optimized we can go further in the tree and our solver would be smarter but I'm not sure where I have my problem since I have implemented most of the heuristics. 

My code is checking for monotonicity, smoothness, pattern to enforce even more to play in the corners, empty tiles and max tile but it keeps reaching, as maximum, 512 so I think I have a problem either in the implementations or at the minmax algorithm itself but, to be honest, I can't see where the problem is. 

Are these heuristic enough for reach a better tile with 7 levels of depth in the search tree?

You correct to characterize them as optimizations. However, even without optimizations if you set the depth to 4-5 you should see better scores than 512 on average even with a very simple heuristic of counting the empty tiles.

The rest of my response is regarding the heuristics. Debugging is quite tricky in my opinion. I used print statements and output to the console but maybe someone knows a better way and will enlighten us. Do you print the values for your heuristics on each board? Pipe all the output to a file. Reviewing the scores on a known board setup can help you figure out if they are given you good values. Do you know what kind of values to expect? Another mistake to watch out for is how you specify X/Y coordinates. If they get backward at any point you end up sending up/down vs left/right commands. As an experiment I tried this and found that the PlayerAI performs very badly with such a mistake.

Sfullmer suggestions below are great. To add to them, I will try to respond to your questions point by point:

1) Handling time limit vs. efficiency: as in most projects, there are many ways to handle this problem. I would keep in mind that as the tree is expanded, the number of nodes to be explored grows exponentially (which goes with what Sfullmer mentioned). Knowing this, you can set a while loop in the beginning of the algorithm to increase the max depth as long the minimax search returns a node within a certain time limit (you’d have to play with it to find a good one, as there is no right/wrong. Just bear in mind that even if you repeat the call within the while loop to get a sense of how deep you can go, shallow depths are calculated very quickly and repeating the call in shallow depths isn’t as time consuming). You can also check the time constraints within the mini/max functions and return an empty node in case the time is almost running out. Again, there is no right or wrong, but play with how far you can stretch your program to make the most of the 0.2 seconds per move you have.

2. Heuristics: from my experience, I could not get 2048 with just 2 heuristics and I think it would be very difficult to do so. As Sfullmer mentioned, monotonicity is a good one (to understand why, just playing the game would help!). Empty tiles and max tile are other ones that can be helpful. There are also others such as smoothness.

3. Tuning weights: finding a good weight balance can be very time consuming, but the right weights will get you to a better score. I’d say don’t be conservative when tuning the weights, assign large numbers just for the purposes of experimentation (how large it will depend on implementation). For certain functions (if not for all of them), use log2 to smooth them out and keep proportions among weights (for instance, if max_tile is 2048, the function shouldn’t return 2048, as this would obviously blow up the proportions). Also think that in special cases you might want to assign a higher or lower weight: for instance, a full board is extremely bad while a 2048 tile is extremely good (knowing these cases will come with watching your program unfold and playing the game yourself).

In week 6, Q8 is already a constructed question, okay. Here, the record is divided into two equally sized parts, albeit with the arbitrary criterion even_or_odd, it could indeed contribute to decision-making. In a realistic data set with several hundred instead of only 14 applicants, this would be different. Realistic would be much more refusals than hiring. But you can calculate that.

Q7 is Tricky, so that's it. My first opinion was that this is a stupid thing to assign to each record a different value. What's the point of this with thousands or millions of records? A decision tree with many branches can make no sense.

The first two weeks are very weakly if we compare with the rest of the course and when you finally realize of all the stuff are coming upon your shoulders you CAN NOT cancel the course because the period for money refund is now after 14 days and the only chance you have is unenroll with nothing more that loss all the progress you made and wait for another course and start again with other pay.

I have threequestions regarding Assignment 1:



'maximum_search_depth' : Isn't this user specified for DFS? For example I can as well specify 1e6 as max search depth but this for the 8 puzzle isn't theoretically justified. Thus, a reasonable search depth needs to be specified by the user. If so, is the assessment based on the user guessing/using the 'right' search depth?

'time' : Is there anything wrong with using time.time() and finding execution time as the difference between subsequent time.time() calls as follows?
start_time = time.time()

1) In the Example # 1 the sample output shows search_depth: 3, max_search_depth: 4. Given that this is breadth first search how is it possible that the algorithm should go deeper than the solution? Shouldn't all nodes at each layer be tested before moving down to the next layer?

2) The assignment states that for the A star algorithm we use the Manhattan priority function but do not consider '0' to be a tile. When I do this I get an optimal path on the examples in the FAQ (same path cost as example) but it produces a different path. If I treat '0' the blank tile as a tile included in the score then I get exactly the same result as the example in the FAQ. Is it correct that '0' should be ignored when calculating the Manhattan priority score?

Many thanks",Mtc000,,mtopcat@gmail.com,,,,CSMM101,105/discussion/6516,audit,

1) max_search_depth is ""the maximum depth of the search tree in the lifetime of the algorithm"", so that means that if you add a node to the frontier, you must account that depth in the max_search_depth

2) you may end up getting different paths depending on the implementation, but as long as it is optimal you should be fine.

Let us take a simplified example to illustrate this: a 2 tile version with tiles (1, 0). If we count 0 the heuristic cost becomes 1+1=2, however, the actual cost is 1(as 1 move is enough to lead to required position (0, 1)). Since the function exceeds actual cost, it would not be admissible and, the A* search would not be optimal.",Baibhav_bista,,baibhav.bista@fusemachines.us,Mtc000,,mtopcat@gmail.com,CSMM101,105/discussion/6516,verified,audit

I've been trying to reproduce the exact output of DFS example 2:

$ python3 driver.py dfs 1,2,5,3,4,0,6,7,8

path_to_goal: ['Up', 'Left', 'Left']
cost_of_path: 3
nodes_expanded: 181437
search_depth: 3
max_search_depth: 66125
running_time: 5.01608433
max_ram_usage: 4.23940217


I infer from the above exact output that the 'max_search_depth' limit for DFS should be specified to 66125. Next when I run my DFS, if the nodes are expanded in the UDLR sequence, there is a solution at depth 31. Thus we don't find the exact solution ['Up', 'Left', 'Left']. This is because after 'Up', 'Left' you have ['Down', 'Left', 'Right'] as available moves and you expand 'Down' {UDLR}. Thus you land up with the following path.

path_to_goal:['Up', 'Left', 'Down', 'Down', 'Left', 'Up', 'Up', 'Right', 'Down', 'Down', 'Left', 'Up', 'Up', 'Right', 'Down', 'Down', 'Left', 'Up', 'Up', 'Right', 'Down', 'Down', 'Left', 'Up', 'Up', 'Right', 'Down', 'Down', 'Left', 'Up', 'Up']

search_depth:31
max_search_depth:32
runnning_time:0.07719874382019043

I would suggest to compare you algorithm of the DFS from the lecture. Yes, there is a solution at depth 31 but DFS searches the leftward most path first and then search move to the next leaf of the root node. Please keep in mind of this condition.

I have the same condition, finding solution on depth 31. I am sorry but I was not able to understand your comments in a way that would change how my code is written.

I also want to share my own experience with this course when I was taking it.

Coming from an non-CS background (my background is in music and I only formally started my CS training not long before I took this class), I really had to work hard on the projects to understand the algorithms. I had a good foundation on Data Structures but my background in math wasn't super strong back then, so I also had to make sure to fully understand some calculus concepts (such as derivatives, integrals, dot products) to fully understand some Machine Learning algorithms.

Project 2 was by far the one I had to put the most time (if you are still in it and feeling like you're struggling, we've all been there!). Project 3 was also quite challenging because of some math.

As Nicole pointed out, I also suggest starting the projects as early as possible so that you could think about it in multiple small chunks rather than in one big sitting. Some projects may be overwhelming at first, but you'll definitely learn so much by working on them on your own.

I also referred to text book only when I thought I needed more info. I would recommend downloading the slides (available in the first video of each week), or even printing them out (multiple of them per page to save space/paper) so you can take annotations on them.

You're right that the editing seems a bit weird, but the content looks correct. In the Naive Bayes video, she just goes back and forth through slides and repeats one question, but the subsequent material seems correct. She skips the second slide of text classification, but the material for it is covered in the next slide. Do you feel you missed some explanations?

What do other students think?

The issue I'm having is how do I calculate these values for a single sample? Here is an example:



Id       Sleep      Study         Passed

0        2 hrs       2 hrs          no

1        1 hrs       3 hrs          yes

2        4 hrs       2 hrs          no

3        4 hrs       4 hrs          yes



In this example I want to predict whether or not I'll pass given a certain amount of sleep and study time. if I try to use Id to calculate gain and entropy I get singularities in the equations. How do I work around this?

For example Entropy( 2, 2 ) = - 2/4 log2( 2/4 ) - 2/4 log2( 2/4 ) = 1

But if I try to determine gain I get:

Gain = Entropy( 2, 2 ) - 1/4 * Entropy( 1, 0 ) .... for the other 3 'classes'.

The problem is that the log (any base) of 0 is -infinity. Would the gain for this example be 1? 0? My hunch is that it would be one because if I take the limit of Entropy ( 1, 0 ) by doing  Entropy ( 0.9, 0.1 ) and Entropy ( 0.99, 0.01 ) the value goes toward 0. Does that make sense though?

I'm unsure how to go about calculating this and looking at the wikipedia article for the ID3 algorithm doesn't give any insight.

I believe we that we assume that the undefined portion as 0. From an intuitive standpoint, when all the sample are homogeneous, the node is pure and therefore no information can be gain from further splitting. I believe that it is just an edge case you have to deal with. If you look at the source code for the sklearn package:

        cdef double entropy = 0.0
        cdef double count_k
        cdef SIZE_t k
        cdef SIZE_t c

        for k in range(self.n_outputs):
            for c in range(n_classes[k]):
                count_k = sum_total[c]
                if count_k > 0.0:
                    count_k /= self.weighted_n_node_samples
                    entropy -= count_k * log(count_k)




 I believe that this statement might still not be concrete enough for you. Does anyone else has any inputs?

There is no learning rate for the perceptron. You're simply updating:

w0 = w0 + X0 * Y

w1 = w1 + X1 * Y

w2 = w2 + Y

Learning rates exist when you are trying to optimize a solution, like in linear regression, when you are trying to find the line/plane that minimizes the square distance of all datapoints to the plane. The perceptron doesn't find the optimal line, it just gives a line that separates the datapoints in two labels (the line could end up being arbitrarily bad depending on initialization).

You have three features if you count the intercept. Add 1 to the row of features and you have 1 (x0), x1, x2 in our example case.

The step function of the dot product of the example and the weights is the prediction / hypothesis of the label for that example. What you have is correct for the example, but not generally for n features. Xi is the features in vector form and it includes all of the features for that example. (for all of j as described). yi is multiplied by the predicted label to determine if the PLA has correctly predicted the output. If less than 0, the PLA has an error. yi is multiplied by the example's (xi) values to adjust the PLA's W in the correct direction.

As for PQ vs heapq: Yeah that would be redundant to use both. You can use heapq to write your own priority queue and I think the PQ just actually uses that. But then you would have to figure out how to make it work and that could be a rabbit hole. I agree with Rogerio in using a separate list is the easiest and fastest approach for the cost of using extra memory.

It seems like you have probably been with us for the last iteration. We have made some changes since the last iteration with the code. 

1. We are only working in python3 now. 

2. Submission should be only PlayerAI.py. (Please read instruction on the instructional page for more detail)

3. PlayerAI_3.py is no long in use. Also, GameManager_3.py no longer exist. To run you code simply type python3 GameManager.py.

I would save a local file of you PlayerAI and reset the assignment, so you have all the correct starter code, which is also the one that we are using in our grading script.

I'm having trouble matching betas for the alpha < 1. My learning rate and number of iterations are correct.

On visual inspection, I find that my linear regression model fits the data well with a plane when alpha = 0.5. See attached image. I initially thought that the way I was computing standard deviation to normalise the data was perhaps resulting in different values of betas. However, I'm confident that my data normalisation is ok:

for col in range(0, data.shape[-1]):
    data[:, col] = (data[:, col] - np.mean(data[:,col]))/np.std(data[:, col])


I also update the values for betas based on the gradient decent rule for the project. (double verified).

Here is the grader results  when alpha=0.5 >>>

alpha = 0.5: iterations passed [1/1]
alpha = 0.5: b_intercept failed [0/1]
alpha = 0.5: b_age failed [0/1]
alpha = 0.5: b_weight failed [0/1]

When I specify alpha = 0.5 >>> 

alpha = free: alpha passed [1/1]
alpha = free: iterations passed [1/1]
alpha = free: b_intercept passed [1/1]
alpha = free: b_age passed [1/1]
alpha = free: b_weight passed [1/1]

So am presuming the test for a user specified alpha is different from other cases??

This doesn't help narrow down on the problem either. 

Any clues on what I could investigate next?

I also tried implementing examples from the web and they give the same response for betas in all cases. I tried forcing data to be float32 and 64 and both fail the same.

Maybe we are doing something wrong on the data normalization, since I've crosschecked with other algorithms online and also sklearn results.

Additionally, if I  increase the iteration count they will all converge to the same result (for the alphas lower than 0.5), which match all other examples

So far I am doing 30/50 in that problem and will probably leave it. I am confident the Linear Regression with GD that is implemented and submitted is correct

So using fit() et al. implies that you have to manage cross-validation by hand, and in this aspect I find Question 3´s instructions rather misleading as it drove me into using existing facilities (such as cross_val_score()) to implement my solution...

It converges at a random line high above the data points (with a large b-intercept).



Here are the rules I am following:

Setup: I have set x0 to be 1, so it multiplies against the intercept b, x1 is the x axis, x2 is the y axis.

i being the example index, j being the dimension

1. For each example, compute f(x). f(xi) = w0(xi0) + w1(xi1) + w2(xi2)

2. if that example i f(xi) * y <= 0 then there is an error

3. Update all weights for the given example in all dimensions.

x0 is always set to 1, y is the desired output (-1 or 1)

w0 => w0 + y * (x0)

w1 => w1 + y * (x1)

w2 => w2 + y * (x2)

4. Move onto the next example, but keep track of the weight

5. Repeat 1-4 until the weights in the next iteration matches the previous weight.



Does this sound correct? Also why is Step 2 (above)  for f(xi) * y <= 0, use less than or equal to 0 (instead of just less than)? It seems that the polarity would be opposite if the value is negative, not 0.

Thank you for reporting this, our staff are looking into this actively to see if the variability can be reduced. Our scripts are not perfect and since we are doing a gradient descent method, there bound to be variances. Please try to first look into you code for any errors first before you attempt to submit the resubmit you code many times, as the correct result with the enough iteration of pass on the dataset will produce a correct grade.

Because i lost too much time (totally stucked in assignment 2 with min-max algorithm and due to issues in my job) i think that i will not be able to complete the course on time. If i want to repeat the course, what is the procedure?

 Can i enroll at any time or is there a certain date? 

Will i have specific time period to complete the course or  will it be self-passed?

Do i have to repeat assignment one and the quizzes i already did or does the program keeps my scores?

Is there something else i have to  take care of?

I check your works in the backend and I assume you are working locally. We suggest you submit your projects and see how you are doing. Those will grow your total grade a lot. Just keep in mind, the final exam is 30% of the total grade.

Unfortunately, we do not have any extension about the deadlines.

The way to repeat the course is enrolling in the verified track in spring.

Hope the answer helps.

We understand project 2 is the hardest one in this course. If you stuck on project 2, you can skip project two and move on to other assignments. Just keep in mind, the final exam is 30% of the total grade. If you are working on your Projects locally, we suggest you submit your codes and see the grades first. Those will grow your total grade a lot. Actually you are on a great process if you can finish the rest of the projects and quizzes, and attend the final exam.

Yes. All the assignments and quizzes will be due on Dec. 8th 2019. The final exam will be released on Dec. 9th, 2019. The course will be end on Dec. 16th, 2019.

If you cannot finish the course on time, you need to enroll (pay)in the verified track again when we provide the course in the spring. 

Your study materials will keep in your course even if it ends. You can review and go back to see any time you need.  However, you cannot launch the projects, quizzes, and final exam when the course ends. If you will retake the course, the previous record of your submissions of all the assignments and quizzes will be gone, which means that's a new course for you.

First of all, I think it's good that you can repeat the course in February.
With me there is little chance to obtain the certification, even if I still achieve good results in the exam. It is understandable that everything that contributes to the rating will be deleted after the course. Between Dec. 16th, 2019 and February, will there be access to the ED Discussion Forum and Vocareum? 

It is unfortunate that repeaters are charged for the full price. For me, the sum is not small (half a month's rent), although bearable, but for participants from low-income countries, it looks different. I wish that all who fail this time can be back in February.
Good luck to all who can do it and who want to repeat it.

First of all I'd like to congratulate both the staff and the students for taking on this great challenge. I've enjoyed this course a lot, even if it's produced me several headaches and not infrequent frustration.

Just wanted to share with you that I struggled with Linear Regression because I subtracted the predictor from the labels (Y - X*w) but it turns out you need to reverse this order, as it affects the final result, contrary to the analytic solution.

I have several questions for it... =)

1.- I'm wondering whether we should insert complementary arcs in the arcs queue or not considering and considering any arc ""bilateral"".

I mean, for arc [[1,2],[2,2]], which means both cells should be different, should we put in arcs queue arc [[1,2],[2,2]] and [[2,2],[1,2]], or just when we found [[1,2],[2,2]] make the process on both ways? (Revising their domains and reinserting their arcs?)

2.- Should we check the arcs for two undefined values of the sudoku? Because that would create strange results...

1- The result looks similar to me, although it can complicate the algorithm quite a bit as you should check at every iteration that the symmetrical arc has not already been inserted in the queue... I haven't tried it, but it seems that it would lead to a tricky implementation. Dunno, my two cents really.

2- I don't understand your question. Could you possibly give an example?

I've managed to find a way to deal with symmetrical arcs, even though something is wrong with my current implementation, I don't think that the problem is with it.

For the second question, I meant that I have assumed that we should not check any positions with another position that has not been already checked (so it has already its domain reduced).

Not sure if now is clearer... =)

Sorry I didn't see your post earlier.

It turns out that after an arc was revised in AC3, I was adding new arcs with :

for tile_constraint_index in [peer_index for peer_index in arc.xi.peer_indexes if peer_index != arc.xj.tile_index]:
    arcs.put(Arc(self.grid, arc.xi, tile_constraint_index))


I simplified it to :

for tile_constraint_index in (arc.xi.peer_indexes - set({arc.xj.tile_index})):
    arcs.put(Arc(self.grid, tile_constraint_index, arc.xi))


and what do you know, it works!

My English is mediocre. 

It is enough for simple conversations, even if I am not familiar with the vocabulary even for everyday objects. As a result, I often need a dictionary or Google Translator. However, since my IT studies I have been practicing reading English-language literature. Of course with dictionary.

For the first few weeks, I've tried to understand all the lessons in English first, looking up the dictionary or using Google Translate. I had to look up about 3-5 words per video. At the beginning I also reduced the video speed to 0.75. 
From the fifth week, the learning material was increasingly new to me, and I have changed my approach. First of all, I procure some learning materials in my native language German, for example in the German Wikipedia or lecture notes of German-speaking universities. I can also read these much faster than English literature.
It was not until I became familiar with the subject in my native language that I followed the EDX lessons. That was much better. Some English technical terms are not so common in German sources, but in university manuscripts, the English terms are always named alongside the German names. 

I often use Google and Deepl Translator. But you should not blindly trust the translator. I'd say that every tenth sentence is translated inaccurately and every 100th is translated incorrectly or with false meaning. Without online translator and dictionary I could not follow the course at all, an achievement of machine translation. 

I'm interested in what happens to other non-English speakers.  ",Stefan-Marok,,stefan.marok@computacenter.com,,,,CSMM101,105/discussion/10688,verified,

I have two questions here about the 'imdb_tr.csv' file we are supposed to generate.

First of all, including plain text values in a CSV file is somehow awkward in our case unless either this text is encoded, or the separating value is not a coma. Are we allowed to use another separating character? Will it affect the grading process?

Then, should stopwords be removed from the csv file, or in-memory once the file data is loaded for computation?

The main question here being whether or not the 'imdb_tr.csv' file will be part of the grade or not...

Hello all,

Following the instructions of assignment 5 leads to handling insanely huge sets of data (such as bigram sets for instance: working with a few 100 cleaned-up lines from the training set gives about 7 million possible word combinations that are supposed to serve as column headers for the model data representation... How can one possibly work with such immense data structures when I use a complete training set?)

The facts are, my code is making Vocareum fail over memory problems, and I don't know how I should solve this.

I am pretty confident I am not using/splitting the training data set as I should, but I'm completely lost even after having successfully completed assignment 4, k-folding, cross-validating and all.

Once again, I need some good advice here as to how I should pre-process or split data sets in order to achieve the given model training without making Vocareum blow up.

Thanks to anybody who'd be glad to help.

I have split the Proposition P: ""John is not tall and John is thin."" in the two parts P1: ""John is not tall"" and P2: ""John is thin"" and then applied the De Morgan rule. The result seems strange, because colloquially a double negation is perceived as an intensification of negation.

It has been an exciting set of weeks learning about such a diverse set of topics. I was trying to figure out what potential areas of intersection lie between the learnings form this course and Quantum computing. Given that IBM is now providing the QISKit framework for anyone to develop algorithms to test on their machines. 

I currently see two areas of intersection. The first, is where all the tools in AI that require the use of probabilities. Eg. the expectimax search algorithm, regression in machine learning. The second, is logical agents. For the latter, many of the conventional operators and operations will have to be reworked but that is a possible intersection.

I was curious about more such intersections (at least in philosophy) so that I could dig a little deeper. 

@Staff, any advice on which sources I could refer to and which research groups I could follow for insights here. I'm very curious to learn about the potential applications of Quantum Computing in the field of AI.

I think that the main bottleneck has to do with the huge amount of resources needed to run big training sets. That's the reason why there are companies working hard to develop hardware equipment capable of doing, in a more effcient way, the calculations that are made nowadays.

I've found some interesting articles about this. Eg. Google is developing a Raspberry Pi-like board aimed for IA (it's called Coral). Also from Google, Google Colab offers free virtual machines in the cloud for running IA software (https://colab.research.google.com/).

Finally, I would recommend to take a look to Cerebras project, a super-computer with a 400k cores processor.

Imho, IA is really fascinating nowadays :-)

I tried to do that, cleaning up as much as possible the input text to only keep relevant words. My opinion is that we should do so. On the other hand, this is a very tricky process and I'm still struggling with side effects that introduce errors in the database and make later processes fail...

To me, only removing stop words is not enough, but doing a better job is nightmarish. I'd appreciate other points of view, but nobody answered my posts on the subject.

In my opinion in the cases like ""He's"" or ""Hes"" should be the same clean it or not because the program does not care about working always with or without the apostrophe. However in other cases as, i.e., ""film"" is not going to be considered the same as ""film."" and this can cause problems. 


I´m not able to achieve any score in the submission and I think is because of this. This is the grading report I´m receiving:

I first replaced any punctuation with a space. I did this by using the list of punctuation in ""string.punctuation"". There are a variety of ways to do this which you can google. I did this on each row as I read it from the original files. Why did I replace with a space instead of removing altogether? The hint to do that was located in the stopwords file. You will see there are some single characters, like ""I"" and ""m"", but not ""Im"". This indicates the word ""I'm"" is supposed to be split into ""I m"" and then cleaned up. 

HINT: You can add to the stopwords yourself. Look at the input data. Is there anything that appears often that isn't a word? 

After removing the punctuation and creating the CSV file and reloading it, I used CountVectorizer to vectorize the data. I do this twice, once for unigram and once for bigram. You will notice in the documentation that CountVectorizer can accept a list of stopwords that it will remove for you. Also notice it accepts a parameter that makes it into a unigram or bigram vectorizer.

https: // scikit - learn.org / stable / modules / generated / sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html

Not for itself but the following lane:
Equivalent to CountVectorizer followed by TfidfTransformer.

It helped me to know how to get the representation with tf-idf that was one of the points that more blocked me.

Another useful tip can be: are you transforming your data properly to get the document-term matrix? You need to fit your vectorizer with the train data and later transform it and feed your classifier with this transformed data.

As the tip that helped me: read the comments in the starting code of driver.py and follow them. It is more useful than I expected at the beginning.

I think the fact that you got such good grades on the unigram show that you are doing everything correctly. Either you have mistakenly passed the wrong argument to your bigram CountVectorizer, or there is some simple mistake with it. I say this because looking at my code, both the unigram and bigram get fed the same information, and they are set up largely the same way other than ngram_range.",Jakelstr,,jakelstr@gmail.com,Jmarrel,,j.marrel@icloud.com,CSMM101,105/discussion/11163,verified,verified

There's still one thing that worries me somehow at a more general level.

Some of us students seem to get good results passing through very different ways. To name one, I see some of us stating that we should only use bigrams for the ngram_range parameter; others will use both unigrams and bigrams. And I can find diverse examples of the severals ways to go to get acceptable grades.

The thing is, it leads me to think we don't really know what is happening in here. We try, we fail. we succeed. But we mainly tinker, play around, and this is not quite satisfying to me. I'm wondering if anybody else is sharing this feeling.

I wished we could have deeper explanations from the teachers once the deadline is met...

Easy example, with quizzes if you get a question wrong the majority of the explanations are ""Answers are displayed within the problem"".  There's no actual explanation of how you were supposed to arrive at the correct answer.

Even if it were as simple as ""Explained in Lecture 2, part 3"", that would already be helpful.

That being said, for the bigram / unigram example, perhaps the implication is that there actually isn't one correct answer?  That either lead to an acceptable result?  My guess is that you will get better results the richer your vocabulary is, so maybe even an ngram range of 1,3 or 1,5 would be more accurate?  At that point it's just a tradeoff between time and accuracy.

However I would still love to know how some users were preprocessing / processing the data to get higher than 90% accuracy.

About the unigrams/bigrams things, I agree there must be tradeoffs at all levels. But still, if only for this specific example, I'd like to understand how one is able to get over 90/100 using one technique I didn't use, because not being able to do so myself means there are aspects to the problem I don't quite grasp.

Anyway, to get back to the original subject, My pre-processing is straightforward really : I ended up letting CountVectorizer do the job, after trying to do everything myself, including removing stop-words, cleaning up punctuation, removing html tags, you name it, I tried it all but it brought nothing more to the final score. So I simplified my code as much as I could, submitted it, and go a decent grade.

But I'm still not intellectually satisfied.

The sgd classifier being run on my count data (normal counts or tf-idf, it doesn't matter), is not getting higher than 85% when I cross-validate.  The grader gives me 0% on all four cases, with no other output.  Can someone from the staff please tell me if my low classifier accuracy is what is causing the 0%, so that I don't waste so much time trying to fix something that might not even be wrong?

In case anyone is having trouble with the assignment, my particular problem was probably related to understanding the difference between vectorizer.fit(), vectorizer.transform(), and vectorizer.fit_transform().  I didn't realize you could (or you have to?) reuse the same vectorizer for both the training and the test data.  Before I was creating a new vectorizer for the test data using the training data's vectorizer vocabulary in the vocabulary parameter, then fit_transforming to the test data text.

The vocabulary is generated when you call fit() on the training set, and then transform() converts that into a document-term matrix, which you use for training the SGD. It's possible that the test set has words that were not previously seen, which would completely wreck the SGD because the document-term matrix would be larger (or smaller). So, by calling transform() on the test set using the vectorizer you got from calling fit() on the training set, you get a document-term matrix which is of the same dimensions. Any words that do not appear in the test set are just marked 0, and any words that appear in the test set but not in training are just excluded.

In order to catch up on my 2 weeks backlog I didn't watch the videos of the 10th week at all.  The 10th week quiz fortunately had no reference to examples in the videos. But I browsed through the handout and found out that this is a traditional subject from mathematics and computer science. As if I could fall back on sources in my mother tongue, which I can understand much faster. I was able to answer the quiz questions very well. Except for a carelessness in translating question 9. Here I confused statement logic with predicate logic and understood first-order logic as circuit logic. Only after the wrong input I knew what was meant: first-order-logic with predicates, functions, variables and quantifiers as well as the statement logic operators AND OR XOR...  
Good luck to all of you.

I've been going through my assignments trying to fix any small bugs and/or edge cases, but I cannot solve my issue where I am losing a few marks from getting the incorrect nodes_expanded. I would like to clarify the meaning of what is meant by the expanded number of nodes:



Does the Root Node (initial state), count has an expanded nodes when the frontier is initialized and the root nodes are added to it?

If a given node has no children (i.e.  is a leaf), and the algorithm attempts to expand it (thus not adding any children to the frontier), does this node/leaf count as an expanded node?

Similarly to 2 above, but in the case where a given node has children, but they have all already been added to the frontier and/or been explored (such that none are added to the frontier), does this count as an expanded node?

If anyone from the staff would be willing to look at my code and point be in the right, direction, that would be very much appreciated. I have read through every thread on the forum and tried solving all the edge cases I could think of, but I still have a DFS test case and an A* test case that return the wrong result.

Yes, I have looked over that post. If I use the length of the explored set as the number of expanded nodes, I get inconsistent results across the board. (I realize there might be edge case to account for this). Per your comment in that post, I had been using my own counter, which adds to the count whenever the children of a node are requested (i.e. counter incremented immediately beforefor neighbor in neighbors: in lecture note skeleton code). However, this did not provide the correct answer all the time. My current method is to provide an addition check if the node has any neighbors at all, and if it does not, then it won't increment (i.e. only increment counter if neighbors is not empty, regardless of whether any of it's elements are added to the frontier or in the explored set). Using this method, I get the right answer most of the time, except for one DFS and one A* test case by the grader.

As such, I was asking my original questions above so that I could clarify whether my assumptions (in by method explained above) are correct and whether one of these assumptions is the reason I am getting the wrong results.

Just a little bit of feedback about W5:

The way how these supervised learning methods are explained is very clear and interesting. However, a more real-life example of how these algorithms look and are implemented will be awesome. Maybe more technical examples so we can do an immediate implementation of what we had learned (K-nearest Neighbors, something about Regularization, something about K-fold Cross-Validation, and about the Normal Equation Method using Matrix representation and the Gradient descent). At least as the Algorithm with the pseudocode like in the first lectures with the BFS, DFS, and A* will be awesome.

However, I think this w5 course is already full in the amount of info, so it can be just an idea for extra practice activities. I hope I can finish it before the deadline of December 28th. Otherwise, I don't know how I will be able to cover all these topics that I really think will help my actual projects.

to my understanding, the algorithm works the following: 

1. check the city
2. get children
3. go to the next city (this depends on the method (BFS, DFS or UCS) 

This means, that the children are not checked as soon as they appear. Therefore I believe that the example with the map stopped to early and Calgary was identified too early as being the correct goal. For the example of BFS, Santa Fee needed to be checked first if it is the goal (step 1). Calgary was only identified as child but not yet in step 1 (check if it is the goal). 

It is written correctly on the slide (""Order of visit""), but mistakenly explained. Similar to UCS.

Here is my approach so far:

So I read all the given files and stored it as imdb_tr.csv and imdb_te.csv with pandas to_csv. Looks like the example. Then I used the CountVectorizer with the ngram parameters and the given stopwords from the file as parameters (checked this with the debugger). After this I call fit for the training set and then transform to both, the training and the test values.

The SGDClassifier is used with the given paramter and used with the fit function on the training parameter with the expected outcome. Then with the predict function it is used on the test set. This is then stored as ones and zeros per line in the expected files.

Very similar approach with tdfid. But the grader still says 0 points on all the 4 tasks and there is no single hint what is wrong.

I tried a lot. From the file formats, different table names and columns (because the requirements are different from the sample files and what was written in the task page), with cv and without cv, with mixing and without. Nothing helped.

What I did eventually solve my problem: 

1. Ensure the output files names exactly same

2. Ensure polarity output follows ""1\n"" or ""0\n""

3. Take care for the headers in the file - else the prediction output will miss by 1 off from the ""expected answer"" gives you zero score

thought i would share what held me back on this assignment.

i got the dreaded 0.0/100 message and because there is no indication what accuracy the grader got, it's hard to debug.



in my case, two things:

1. while reading the test data I was assigning 'names' in pandas but doing so means 'skiprows' has to be 1 else, you get the off by one error.

2. i got slightly better results by applying the same filter words method (like remove stopwords) to test data even before all the vectorizers and predictions.

also, maybe look at the test data in imdb_te.csv and classify whether they are positive or negative and see if your models are assigning reasonable values - if i had done this earlier atleast i would have caught #1 above

hope this helps.

Shouldn't the correct answer be ""May not reach a minima even if you run it for an indefinite amount of time,"" which would be the case if you choose an alpha value / learning rate that is way too high?  As explained in lecture this would cause the algorithm to bounce back and forth from one side of the local minimum point to the other and never terminate.

""A"" refers to the columns (features) being examined. Let's say the feature is ""Hair"". 

|Sv| is the count of the each attribute, ""short"" and ""long"" in this case.  |S| is the overall count, so it is always 8. 

Gini Sv is the same as the Gini above, but we use the proportions of the particular attribute (short, long) being examined. So Gini-short will be (there 2 is the number of boys with short hair and 1 is the number of girls with short hair):$$1\ -\ \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2-\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2\ =\ \frac{4}{9}$$

Gini-long will be (where 4 is the number of girls with long hair and 1 is the number of boys with short hair):$$1\ -\ \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2-\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2=\ \frac{8}{25}$$



Therefore, the sum will contain two parts:

1) 3/8 * 4/9 = 1/6

2) 5/8 * 8/25 = 1/5

Plugging everything to the Gain (S, A) formula:$$Gain\ \left(S,\ hair\right)\ =\ \frac{7}{16}-\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{5}\approx0.07$$

Do the same for the other attributes (Tall, Name) and pick the one with the largest number.





Hope this helps. Since it's a practice exam, feel free to ask if your answers are correct. Apologies for our delay.

2) About the room...I have a small library in the room I plan to do the exam. It is not close to the desk and of course, is not in front of me. Should I move out of the rooms any book? 

3) About the ID. Should It be the same one that I used to enter in the verified track? I did it with my passport in that case but the lighting in the room and the plastic of the passport make it glitter and is easier to get the picture to my national ID. Is it permitted? 



Maybe look like stupid questions but I don´t want to fail the exam due to this kind of small details.

My internet has been glitchy at my house for the past week and I have no alternative place to take this exam, given the physical restrictions imposed by the Proctored rules. 

The PSI software should really accommodate few seconds of internet outage...

On my first try I scored 30%, being able to answer around 10 questions. On this second try, scored 55% while being able to answer about half the questions before the internet glitch. I am afraid of asking for the test reset again and get an early glitch which would prevent me from answering almost no questions. So I am giving up on the Final Exam out of fear of getting another internet glitch.

I know I was going to do really well in this exam and really prepared for this. Having this low grade in the Final Exam because the PSI software is that strict really puts a stain in this excellent course experience I was having so far. My current Total Grade is now 84% but I know I could do much better if not for the PSI software combined with my bad internet this week.

Why can't PSI continue the recording offline while internet is not restored? That would keep the entire record of the exam. This really seems like an easy fix.

Please let me know if there is any alternative, or at least a way to hold my current grade in case there is another glitch if I can try again. I am not keeping my hopes up though, I understand there are predetermined rules in place.

So you should reset if you don't know your EDX password and login in PSI with your EDX password, not trough 3rd party logins. 

I addition to this, considering it's friday, If I don't get a new exam code today means I will not be able to make the exam because of the deadline on monday? Because I understand EDX support may not work on weekends...

The situation seems to be quite stressing with PSI software for most of us... =S

The edX support team works 24/7 and I am confused for your description of 3rd party logins. You have to login with your edX account (registered with name that matches state-issued ID). 



Your exam is reset and you shall be able to take the final exam now. Please keep us posted if you still have any other questions. Thank you.

I mean, that when you login to edx you can login with your user and password from edx or push in below buttons (Login with Facebook) (Login with google) etc. 

For what PSI told me it's usual getting an error if we try to log with Facebook or Google. 

 We should always log typing the user and password from EDX.Anyway, EDX staff already answered me quite quickly and I've been able to do my final exam. =)

Thank you for your support.

Due to the complication of the proctoring software, the course staff decided to extend the course due date until December 23rd, 2019, 23:30 UTC to let you take (or retake) the proctored final exam. Before you proceed, please make sure you follow these steps before you take the final exam:



Take the practice proctored exam to verify your system compatibility



Use your edX credential to log-in for the final proctored exam



If you use other 3rd party (i.e. facebook or google account) login, you will not be able to access to the final exam. 



Close all other tabs, communication apps or any add-on software (i.e. Skype or Messenger) to prevent any pop-up message which could result in your exam flagged as violating the proctor exam rules. 



There can be many background data using apps you have installed on personal laptops, or network blocking security systems in corporate computers. Each of these can make PSI flag your exam. Therefore, the simpler the computer used, the better. An option is to log in as a ‘guest’ user on your computers (but then, this depends on if you downloaded PSI under all users or your admin account).

If your exam gets locked out or blocked, note that the timer still runs. When it ends, your exam will be submitted for you. We understand this is an issue, and the best resolution is to contact info@edx.org to reset your exam and report this on the discussion forum. PSI cannot reset exams, but they can determine why you were logged out. 


We are here to assist you if you have any other questions.

As many had encountered, I also got the ""bandwidth"" issue which reason was identified by the Secure Software support.  My resolution was 1) to use more powerful CPU, 2) to use lower resolution display,  and 3) to avoid using a PDF reader.

When I took the practice exam with Dell XPS 13 (screen resolution: 3200x1800), the practice was so smooth, and I did not get any issues.  At that time I did not use any other software (as PSI Secure Browser request the confirmation to kill such software), did not browse any other material including Columbia University webpages.  I thought I have no issue with that testing environment.

I took the final exam on Tuesday in the original final week.  I used the same PC in the same wired network environment (which I later measured upstream at 300Mbps, downstream at 700Mbps).  This time I tried to use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to view my notes and the handouts in digital form.  At the 2nd question I wanted to confirm the answer on the handout, and started to flip pages.  Then I was kicked out of the exam.  I contacted the Secure Software and got to know that the reason of disconnection was insufficient bandwidth, which seems a little weird.

I thought it might be the nature of the PSI Secure Browser, because such software should be used also at real test center typically carrying out closed-book tests.  If so, it needs to detect cheating through running other software.  Although the use PDF reader is allowed in our case, running some other software might be affecting in a bad way.  The browser also reminded me at the booting time that it uploads the image from webcam, and all the activity on the screen is recorded.  So it would make sense to think that the use of PDF reader became a big load for the laptop's CPU to compress such higher resolution screen to upload, and it would be possible that such load resulted and/or was detected as insufficient bandwidth.

Based on that assumption, when I retook the exam, I prepared a box PC with a powerful CPU and more memory.  I connected a full-HD (1920x1080) display instead of one with higher resolution.  I also prepared my notes and the handouts in physical form to avoid the use of the PDF reader.  It was a very good experience to take the proctored exam which went so smooth until the end of the exam.

First of all thank you for this amazing course. I really enjoyed it!

I'm wondering whether it is okay to share our work, once the course is completely finalised, of course. Can we upload our projects to e.g. GitHub? I remember having read somewhere we are not allowed to share the solutions online but it should be fine after the course ended. At the end of the day, the projects are our own work, and something we worked at for many hours. It would be very beneficial for us students to be able to show what we developed which would serve as a proof of the acquired skills.

Yes, it is in our guidelines that the codes should not be posted on GitHub. This is mainly due to the fact that our course happens on a recurring basis and it involves a certification. 

If you would like to share with a potential employer, feel free to do so by sharing a private github page with them.

Thank you for your understanding !

Best,

Adam

I tried the exam again yesterday using a different wi-fi connection and a Mac OS 10.13, but it gave me an error message, saying the camera stopped recording. I tried the practice proctored exam first and I finished without any errors, then when I tried the final exam and the camera stopped recording. I was assisted by Abegail Corre from PSI and resolved my issue but the exam was already submitted. I sent an email to edX yesterday and today , for them to reset my exam ,but no one got back to me yet. 

I feel like even if we got an extension for the exam final, it still takes a very long time to get a response from the edX Team. I am so scared that I wont be able to write my exam and finish successfully, its really heartbreaking and frustrating because everyday I have to sit at the office until 23h00 or late just to take my exam, because it takes more than a day to get helped. I really had a bad experience with this exam.  

I just want to get this over and done with but the PSI App has been failing me, but its just with the final exam not with the practice Proctered exam.

Can someone please help me get my exam reset. its already 17h00 here and I it looks like I am going to sit in the office until late again today. :-(

My questions is related to Classification III in assignment 3. I have pasted an excerpt of this question below:



Use SVM with different kernels to build a classifier. Make sure you split your data into training (60%) and testing (40%). Also make sure you use stratified sampling (i.e. same ratio of positive to negative in both the training and testing datasets). Use cross validation (with the number of folds k = 5) instead of a validation set. You do not need to scale/normalize the data for this question. Train-test splitting and cross validation functionalities are all readily available in sklearn.



My questions are as follows:



1. Do I need to run the seven methods listed in this question on the Train-Test data set split (with 60-40 split) and identify the optimal values of the parameters in each of these seven methods for this Train-Test data set split ? 



2. Does the cross validated data set also need have 60% train and 40% test split. Ideally, cross validation is performed by using one fold as a test and other 4 folds as train. With this, we cannot achieve 60% train and 40% test split


I look forward to your responses

The discussion forums are a way for you to share your thoughts about course material, learn from your fellow students, get to know them better, and report problems.
If you have an urgent matter -- such as needing to report a video or other course component that isn't working properly -- you can get the attention of course staff by creating a new post and putting [STAFF] in the title.
 
There are a few other ways you can participate:
 
Select the ""heart"" icon to like  posts and good responses (so the post will move closer to the top of the discussion thread)
 
Select the “star” icon to follow posts for updates
 
Use “watch” to be notified of all activities in the thread
 
You are part of a diverse learning community that forms the heart of a meaningful learning experience. Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:
Be respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.
Be constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.
 
Be sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.
 
Post appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.
 
Users that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.
 
Please help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.
 
In addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!

FORUM POSTING GUIDELINES

What makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:
 
Read before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.
 
Use informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.
 
Make it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.
 
Stay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.
 
Help keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff. 
 
Thanks for keeping the conversation lively and respectful!",Susan,admin,xc2496@tc.columbia.edu,,,,CSMM102,106/discussion/1107,audit,

  Good question, but is somewhat more advanced and tangential to this course, though I'll try to sketch one brief answer. Recall that we have appealed to the ""maximum likelihood"" approach to come up with equations for $\hat{w}_{ML}$ and $\hat{\sigma}_{ML}$. Generally, all maximum likelihood estimators ""asymptotically"" follow a normal distribution with variance/covariances equal to a formula known as the Fisher Information matrix. You can look these up in advanced theoretical statistics textbooks (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation and references therein), but again, is beyond the scope of this course.

$\sigma^{2}$ is a scalar we want an estimator for. By intuition, it should be somehow of the form $\sum_{i}(y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i})^{2}$. Thus we ""guess"" we should take a look at $\mathbb{E}[e^{T}e]$ for $e\triangleq  y-\hat{y} = (I - X(X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T})y = My$. Matrix $M$ is a special ""annihilator"" matrix with few convenient properties (all are easy check) like $M^{T}M=M^{2}=M$ and $MX=0$. So we take a look at

$$\mathbb{E}[e^{T}e] = \mathbb{E}[(My)^{T}My]=\mathbb{E}[y^{T}My]=\mathbb{E}[tr(y^{T}My)] = tr(M\mathbb{E}[yy^{T}])= \\ 
tr(M(\Sigma+\mu \mu^{T}) = tr(M\Sigma) + tr(M\mu\mu^{T}) = tr(\sigma^{2} I M) + 0 = \\ \sigma^{2} tr(I_{n} - X(X^{T}X)^{-1} X^{T}) = \sigma^{2} (tr(I_{n}) - tr((X^{t}X)^{-1} X^{T}X) \\ = \sigma^{2} (tr(I_{n}) - tr(I_{d})) = \sigma^{2}(n-d)$$

where we've used some nice properties of the matrix trace like cyclic shift and others. So we conclude that putting $\hat{\sigma}^{2} = \frac{e^{T}e}{n-d}$ will give us unbiased estimate we need. 

As for variance of en estimator - yes, in general the very high variance of an estimator may be a problem in terms of its quality. However I don't think it's a case here (just guessing as going through calculations seems a bit of an effort) and I reckon this is much more into pure statistics than ML.",Micsza,,michal.szafraniuk@gmail.com,Andrzejcz,,andrzej.czerczak@gmail.com,CSMM102,106/discussion/2398,verified,verified

So I presume conditional densities behave similarly to the event-based probability measures thus for densities $p(\cdot)$:$$p(a|b, c) = \frac{p(a, b, c)}{p(b, c)} = \frac{p(a, b|c)p(c)}{p(b|c)p(c)}=\frac{p(a, b|c)}{p(b|c)}$$

and $$p(a,b,|c)=\frac{p(a,b,c)}{p(c)}=\frac{p(a|b,c)p(b,c)}{p(c)}=p(a|b, c)p(b|c)$$

Q1: Is that correct?

If answer for Q1 is yes, then the Bayes rule is$$p(w | y, X) = \frac{p(y|w, X)p(w|X)}{p(y|X)}$$

vs lecture's one$$p(w | y, X) = \frac{p(y|w, X)p(w)}{p(y|X)}$$

In other words we implicitly assume that $p(w)=p(w|X)$ i.e. $w \perp X$ (unconditionally independent). 

Q2: Is that correct? 

If answer for Q2 is yes, then 

Q3: What is intuition behind such assumption? 

My shot so far: X is obviously some random process as we condition on this, we don't say a word about its distribution though but I guess we don't care. w is unobservable and random and it represents some nature of the dependency between y and X but it's independent on pure X - but still only until we see y. So first we start with prior belief of w, then X show up but we can't update our belief only until we see y so that's why w and X are independent.",Micsza,,michal.szafraniuk@gmail.com,,,,CSMM102,106/discussion/2678,verified,

So I've managed to get a decent score in this part (6/10), but I'm worried that my understanding may not be correct or there are some cases I'm not considering, so here are some questions that hopefully someone can help me answer and also hopefully help someone else:



I calculated Sigma naught squared for each observation in the test set. Is this correct/enough? 

2.  Then for all those values, I select the 10 that are the highest and return the list of indices corresponding from highest to lowest values of sigma naught squared and here are some of my questions:



Let's suppose that there are three equal values of sigma naught squared and the indices are 1, 5 and 7 does the order matter? Or should there not be any repeated values (of sigma naught squared) because that means it is actually the same observation? If so, which one should remain?

I think these are the 2 big parts of this problem and so far I haven't been able to identify on which one I'm lacking to improve my implementation of the lectures. Or if it is an output that I'm not presenting correctly, I would like to know how to interpret the 6/10 if it means that I've had 6 datasets correct out of 10, or if it means that in general, my results present a 60% ""correctness"" to the actual result in average for all datasets tested in my program.

The ellipses correspond to the contours of the residual sum of squares (RSS): the inner ellipse has smaller RSS, and RSS is minimized at ordinal least square (OLS) estimates. There is a trade-off between the penalty term and RSS. We are trying to minimize the ellipse size and circle simultaneously in the ridge regression. The ridge estimate is given by the point at which the ellipse and the circle touch. $$w_{RR}=\left(\lambda I+X^TX\right)^{-1}X^Ty$$$$w_{LS}=\left(X^TX\right)^{-1}X^Ty$$

The solution to ridge regression adds a positive constant to the diagonal of $X^{T}X$ before inversion. So we cannot directly say $w_{RR}$ is proportional to $w_{LS}$.",Tong,admin,ty2387@columbia.edu,Peterdenaro,,pedrodenaro@gmail.com,CSMM102,106/discussion/3074,audit,audit

The answer is yes, but a few things to keep in mind:
A workload consisting of four courses is the same as a full-time student, so you would need to budget your time accordingly.
The time you need to dedicate weekly for each course will depend on your previous knowledge on programming, calculus, linear algebra, and probability. Please refer below for the prerequisites for each course.
Although you could take all courses at once, there is a natural progression in the MicroMasters courses: AI goes well with ML, Robotics with Animation.
For students who are eager to complete the MicroMasters, we recommend you to take a combination of AI and ML in one session and Robotics and Animation and CGI in another because AI introduces some concepts that will be featured in ML while Robotic tends to have a lighter course load compared to the heavy course load in Animation and CGI, which serves as a great complement. Each course is offered twice a year, once in the Fall (Sep-Dec) and once in the Spring (Feb-May).
Here is a breakdown of prerequisites for each course:
AI: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, derivatives), Calculus, Basic probability theory, Python programming
ML: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, derivatives), Calculus, Basic probability theory, Python programming
Robotics: Linear algebra, Knowledge of Linux environment, Python
Animation and CGI:  Multi-variable calculus, linear algebra, C++, knowledge to navigate a large codebase

I'm slightly unclear on some of the variance terms.

A 1D Gaussian PDF would be:

$p(x, \mu, \sigma^2)$

Where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma^2$ is the variance.

In week 1, we had:

$p(x | \mu, \Sigma)$ with $x, \mu \in \R^d, \Sigma \in \R^{d \times d}$

Where we found $\Sigma$ through the arithmetic average of outer products of $x - \mu$.

Now, in Bayesian linear regression, we use 

Likelihood model: $y \sim N(Xw, \sigma^2 I)$

Prior: $w \sim N(0, \lambda^{-1} I)$

My question is: is the $\sigma^2$ in the likelihood model a scalar that is multiplied by the identity matrix? If so, what is the value that goes in here? And why does it not take on a different value per-dimension?

And, in the prior, is $\lambda^{-1}$ also a scalar, as in the $\lambda$ that is used as a scaling factor in ridge regression? Or is it now an inverse matrix?

A late joiner here; thanks so much for organizing this course and forum.

I'm a bit stuck on deriving the Gaussian Covariance MLE (from lec 1, ""Examples"" video, ""Gaussian Covariance MLE"" slide).

We need to take the partial of$$-\frac{n}{2}\ln\left(\det\left(\Sigma\right)\right)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_i^{ }\left(\left(x_i\ -\ \mu^{ }\right)^T\Sigma^{-1}\left(x_i\ -\ \mu\right)\right)$$

and set it to 0.

Interestingly, one approach (see Section 13.5.3) seems to take partial w.r.t. the inverse of Covariance matrix:$$\frac{\partial l}{\partial\Sigma^{-1}}=\frac{N}{2}\Sigma\ -\frac{1}{2}\sum_n^{ }\left(x_n\ -\mu_{ML}\right)\left(x_n-\mu_{ML}\right)^T\ =\ 0$$

While I understand the derivations for this approach, I do not see why taking partial w.r.t. inverse of covariance must provide same MLE as taking partial w.r.t. (univerted) covariance.

Another approach takes partial w.r.t. Covariance matrix, not its inverse. But, it uses equation 63 from Matrix Cookbook:$$\frac{\partial\ Tr\left(AX^{-1}B\right)}{\partial X}\ =\ -\left(X^{-1}BAX^{-1}\right)^{^T}$$

unfortunately, I am having a tough time deriving this equation.

This course does not require going deep into statistical theory or matrix algebra, but to answer your question about alternate ways of solving the gaussian mle equations: it can be shown that for any function g (for example, the matrix inverse), if $\hat{\theta}$ is an mle of $\theta$, then $g(\hat{\theta})$ is an mle of $g(\theta)$.

Least squares is used when X is ""skinny"" -- more rows (i.e. observations or examples) than columns (i.e. explanatory variables or features). In this case, the system is overdetermined, and $w_{ls}$ is an approximate solution of $Xw \approx y$ (which minimizes the squared errors $||Xw - y||$).  Note that the least norms solution cannot even be calculated in this case because we cannot determine the inverse $(XX^T)^{-1}$ which does not have full rank.

Least norms is used when X is ""fat"" -- more columns than rows.  In this case, the system is underdetermined, and there are many solutions of $w$ such that $Xw = y$ exactly (so we choose the one that minimizes the norm $||w||$).

Different $p$'s define different models, each of which has its own solution. The $p$ is an input or user-specified preference (the value of $p$ essentially specifies how much more we want to weight large versus small entries), and we cannot say whether the solution for one value of $p$ is more optimal than the solution for another.
Separately, the lectures also note that, given a chosen $p$, the solution of the corresponding $Lp$ regression model may or may not be easy to compute. The lectures list those values of $p$ for which there is an easy analytic solution. And they also list other values of $p$ for which the solution can only be computed with numerical methods or approximately; indeed, for some values of $p$, it is known that the solution space is non-convex or has many ""local"" optimums.",Terence_,admin,tl2735@columbia.edu,Manaliedx,,g.manali05@gmail.com,CSMM102,106/discussion/4986,audit,verified

$\Sigma$ is positive definite and hence it has to be invertible. If it is invertible, it implies that it has full rank. Another way to look at it is that if $\Sigma$ was not invertible, then the distribution $$\left(p\left(x\ \right|\ \mu,\ \Sigma\right)\ =\ \frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^{\frac{d}{2}}\det\left(\Sigma\right)}\cdot\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\cdot\left(x\ -\ \mu\right)^T.\Sigma^{-1}.\left(x\ -\ \mu\right)\right)$$

can somebody help me to see how we arrive to the result that the predictive distribution is normal with parameters $\mu_0$ and $\sigma_0$ as they appear in lecture 5?

I have tried to calculate the integral we have for it by plugging the distributions of the integrand terms and I arrive to something like the following:

$$p(y_0|x_0,y,X)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\frac{1}{Z}\mathrm{e}^{ -\frac{1}{2} \{   \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (y_0-x_o^Tw)^2  + (w-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(w-\mu)\}} \mathrm{d}w$$

But I do not know how it is possible to integrate that, since there are quadratic terms in $w$ in the exponent..., and $Z$ is only a product of constants w.r.t $w$ that I have grouped together - similarly as it was done before in the lecture.

What should we do to arrive to the result stated from here? Thank you",Jose123abc,,zzzssshhiu@gmail.com,,,,CSMM102,106/discussion/5844,audit,

That is generally a mess to solve, hence we often assume convenient ""conjugate"" distributions  where analytic solutions have been previously produced. In this case, we rely on the known properties that when the prior and likelihood distributions are Gaussian, so are the posterior and the predictive. That predictive distribution is recognized to be an integral over Gaussian likelihood and posterior distributions (pages 13 and 14 of lecture 5 slides).

But in your future work if you want to use more general distributions for which analytic solutions are not available, then you may need to turn to numerical techniques instead (e.g. Gibbs Sampling, Monte Carlo Markov Chain) but those are beyond the scope of this course.",Terence_,admin,tl2735@columbia.edu,Jose123abc,,zzzssshhiu@gmail.com,CSMM102,106/discussion/5844,audit,audit

I have doubt regarding the steps for active learning.

1.first time covariance matrix, we get from the X_train matrix,that will be for 4 features, 4*4 matrix.

2.Than use the formula as below to calculate the σ² using the variance we calculated in above step,for each of the new  x0 .Selecting the index with maximum σ².

3.finding Σ using above formula,the summation is using loop and it includes the last selected x0(the loop).then calculating the sigma nought square(1st image), for selecting the second index based on max confidence. 

4.Similarly repeating the 3rd step for 3rd index with max confidence,calulating the sumation includes the above 2 selection of x0. and so on

Yes your steps are correct. Just to clarify, calculate the initial SIGMA from training data. Then 10 times, select the training data with max uncertainty and update the SIGMA. Also after selecting a best point, don't select it again as thats a very common mistake and don't forget to update SIGMA as well.

the question say w1 w2 etc

it should really be printed as w sub 1 (subscript - ith component of w), w sub 2....

w1 can easily be misunderstood as another vector in the same space (R3)

Once the x_0 is identified that gives the largest sigma_0^2, set this x_0's index aside, move the x_0 from the test data to the training data, and update the value of sigma^2.

For coding up this classifier, you will need to take the determinant and inverse, which, as you pointed out, would not work with a singular covariance matrix. You probably should try a different data set; you could do some pre-processing on the data with principal components, but then covariance matrix of the transformed features becomes uninteresting (diagonal) for this exercise.",Terence_,admin,tl2735@columbia.edu,Aleary06,,andrew@informed.co,CSMM102,106/discussion/6855,audit,verified

This is a very common issue with this kind of vectorized problems. You need to debug it. See it step by step. Try to compute the same matrices using different code (one with vectorization and one with naive) and then try to see if you are getting same matrices (you can use np.allclose to test that).

ie for each line 

A = from your code probably vectorized

A' = from naive python code



check np.allclose(A, A')

This is the strategy I use while debugging these issues.



Also you can try to compute the pseudo inverse if everything else fails. But we have tested the data and it works.",Sourav,admin,ss5645@columbia.edu,Aleary06,,andrew@informed.co,CSMM102,106/discussion/6855,,verified

Random Forest modifies the Decision Tree algorithm, by taking the average of many trees. Intuitively, this can reduce variance significantly if the underlying trees are not correlated.  RF tries to achieve this by fitting each of its underlying trees from a random subset of dimensions: Each of the trees is more biased (because only a smaller, restricted subset of features is allowed), but also lowly-correlated with each other (because different subsets of features). Hence can expect RF to have greater bias and lower variance than DT.  
See also Lecture 12, Slide 21.  This approach is known more generally as ""bagging"", and can be applied to other classifiers, not just trees.",Terence_,admin,tl2735@columbia.edu,Runerammohan,,arunamatata@hotmail.com,CSMM102,106/discussion/6982,audit,verified

Specifically, the course laid out AN approach to active learning and even described ""active learning"" itself in quotes.  It was not clear to me, the way it was described in lecture or on the slides, that ""active learning"" implicitly meant THE specific strategy laid out in class.  In other words, it came across to me that what was described in class was A WAY (maybe a reasonable one just like ML is reasonable way to predict from probability model) to do ""active learning"" but not ""the way"".

So given that and the Prof's introduction to the subject, my interpretation was that all that is required for an active learning strategy was a sequential plan for how to choose new instances for measurement that is actually feasible to implement based on available information.  

Have I misinterpreted?  Is ""active learning"" as strictly defined as something like ML, or Bayes rule?

  ML is a very large general set of strategies, objective functions, and algorithms; while Bayes Rule is a very specific mathematical equation. By comparison, active learning is a type of ML strategy, where it can select the best next data point, from a candidate set of data points, to learn from which best minimizes the required objective function. Active learning is often used, say, when labelled data points are expensive to come by.  Depending on the required objective function, the formula for picking that next data point may be different -- but this general approach is still called active learning. The lecture discusses a particular objective function (linear regression prediction), which generates a specific formula that should be used for implementing an active learning strategy. Again, if we required or imposed a different objective function, then that would imply different formulas to use in active learning.

It's basically a recap of what have already been written here so I hope I'm not violating any rules:



Tip 1. In each iteration do not forget to update/recompute the covariance matrix (big sigma) $\Sigma = (\lambda I + \sigma^{-2}X^{T}X)^{-1}$ as your measured $X$ changes at each iteration when you add a selected observation to it. That's the whole point here of updating posteriors sequentially. The small sigma parameter $\sigma^{2}$ does not change!



Tip2. Observe that if you remove the selected observation $x_{0}$ from the so far unmeasured set $X_{new}$ then you change its indexes so you need to somehow keep track of the original ones. The easiest way in my opinion is to not remove the selected observation and just make sure you do not select the same row more than once.



Tip3. Don't forget to return the finally selected indexes on ""start with 1"" basis.",Micsza,,michal.szafraniuk@gmail.com,,,,CSMM102,106/discussion/8285,verified,

Our team checks your code. The problem is the training data itself is not the rating matrice. The shape (6000,3 ) doesn't mean there are 6000 users and 3 objects. In the first column, the data refers to the user location, and the second column refers to the object location, the third column is the rating.

Thinking back on working this problem, the most challenging concept for me was understanding how to calculate the covariance :$$\Sigma_y$$

I looked back on Mark Worrall's notes to refresh myself on the theory:

---

Recalling that we are assuming yi∼iidDiscrete(π),xi|yi∼Normal(μyi,Σyi),i=1,…,N , 

I assumed that I would need to find the variance of the features of a certain classification (a scalar), and using the variance, construct a square diagonal matrix Σ corresponding to the specific class. Once Σ was constructed, I could use it in the plugin classifier.

First step is to use your labelled input data to calculate the class prior probability vector $\hat{\pi}$, and the class-specific Gaussian likelihood parameters $(\hat{\mu_k}, \hat{\Sigma_k})$, i.e. mean and covariance matrix, for each class $k$.
Next step is to calculate the posterior probability that a given point belongs to each one of the potential classes -- recall that posterior uses those prior and likelihood distributions, and should form a valid probability distribution.

In Bayesian classification, we model it like this$$\left(p\left(y\right|x\right)=\frac{\left(p\left(x\right|y\right)p\left(y\right)}{p\left(x\right)}$$

This is in slide no. 5

So p(y|x) is the posterior. 

Later in slide 10, when performing maximum likelihood for logistic regression, we use this as likelihood. $$\left(p\left(y_1,y_2,...\right|x_1...,w\right)$$

So these are not the same things right? or are they?

Bayes classifiers calculate $p(y|x) = \frac{p(x|y) p(y)}{p(x)}$: the LHS is derived from assuming some particular probability model for x in the RHS -- hence is known as ""generative"".

On the other hand, logistic regression directly assumes that the likelihood function $p(y|x,w)$ is specifically a product of sigmoidal logit functions (Lecture 9, slide 10). This is not a posterior in a bayesian sense since $x$ is essentially an input, and no probability model for $x$ (nor $x|y$) is required nor assumed -- hence known as ""discriminative"" (slide 9).

Slide 7 provides a motivation for the logistic regression model's likelihood function (i.e. as sigmoidal logit functions): we conveniently want $X^{T}w + w_0$ to represent the equation of the log odds ratio. More generally, we can actually specify different forms of this link function to derive other types of generalized linear models besides the logistic regression.",Terence_,admin,tl2735@columbia.edu,Isu_kumar_shrestha,,isukumar.shrestha@fusemachines.us,CSMM102,106/discussion/8879,audit,verified

What I found mostly valuable was practicing numpy broadcasting. Here I would like to share some tips for Project 2 that I think may be helpful:

Tip1. Get some right debug data, i.e. such that won't produce singular covariance matrices. I generated both training and test debug data randomly but for the reasons I still don't fully understand I constantly ended up with few singular covariance matrices for some classes when training data was not large enough. Obviously we need at least 2 observations for each class in training data to produce some uncertainty within each class (theoretically interesting question arises here how plug-in classifier deals with classes of no variability like those with just one observation in it) but even with exactly 3 observations in each class (30 training examples) I still ended up with at least one singular cov matrix. Yet I don't know why as mathematically speaking the probability that random matrix is singular has Lebesgue measure zero. I suspect it was due to either pseudorandomness or numerical issues. Still though, 4x10 training set finally worked.

Tip2. Check if your covariance matrices are correct: they need to be symmetric and +ve semidefinite (easy check via all non-negative eigenvalues).

Tip3. Mind that the expected output for each test example is a valid predictive distribution, so don't forget to rescale it to sum up to one.",Micsza,,michal.szafraniuk@gmail.com,,,,CSMM102,106/discussion/9005,verified,

I have a problem to see why it is true that the weights of misclassified examples get increased after each iteration. 

Firstly I might be missing something but the above statement is not obvious because $\alpha_{t}=\frac{1}{2}ln(\frac{1-\epsilon_{y}}{\epsilon_{t}})$ may be negative, which happens if $\epsilon_{t} > \frac{1}{2}$. This is possible as if we have all misses then $\epsilon_{t} = 1$, if all hits then $\epsilon_{t}=0$ (meaning $\alpha_{t}$ is not correctly defined but then I presume we just stop) and most interestingly if $\epsilon_{t}=\frac{1}{2}$ we have $\alpha_{t}=0$ so we reach a kinda fixed point with no more updates - I would appreciate some explanation how we actually deal with this case. 

Now to the main point. So let $OK$ be the set of indexes for correctly classified examples and let's assume $i \in OK$. Then let's check the sign of

$$d = w_{t+1}(i)-w_{t}(i) = \frac{ w_{t}(i)e^{-\alpha_{t}} }{N_{t+1}} - w_{t}(i)$$

where $N_{t+1} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{t}(j)e^{-\alpha_{t} y_{j} f_{t}(x_{j}) }$. We can see the sign of $d$ is equivalent to the sign of $d'=e^{-\alpha_{t}} - N_{t+1}$ as $w_{t}(i)>0$.So

$$d' = e^{-\alpha_{t}} - \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{t}(j)e^{-\alpha_{t} y_{j} f_{t}(x_{j}) } =  e^{-\alpha_{t}} - \sum_{j \in OK} w_{t}(j)e^{-\alpha_{t}} - \sum_{j \notin OK} w_{t}(j)e^{\alpha_{t} }$$



Since $\sum_{j \notin OK} w_{t}(j)=\epsilon_{t}$, $\sum_{j \in OK} w_{t}(j)=1-\epsilon_{t}$ and $e^{\alpha_{t}}=(\frac{1-\epsilon_{t}}{\epsilon_{t}})^{0.5}$ we get that sign of $d'$ is the same as the sign of 

$$d''=(\frac{1-\epsilon_{t}}{\epsilon_{t}})^{-0.5} - (\frac{1-\epsilon_{t}}{\epsilon_{t}})^{0.5}$$ which is positive iff $\epsilon_{t} >\frac{1}{2}$.  So the statement that the weights of misclassified examples get increased after each iteration is not true as it depends on $\epsilon_{t}$ whose weight is boosted and whose is not.",Micsza,,michal.szafraniuk@gmail.com,,,,CSMM102,106/discussion/9010,verified,

https://us.edstem.org/courses/106/discussion/9143,question,Perfectly works on my PC but very poor when submitting,Projects,Project 2,0,False,2019-11-16T02:05:09.139233+11:00,"I am truly enjoying this class. It goes much deeper than I learned at undergraduate school class. However I'm struggling with implementing plug in classifier.

I checked my code with the data I downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository

It works perfectly on my PC with the data I downloaded.

But when I submit my code on Vocareum, the score looks funny and it's even random between 5~10 out of total 25

Here is what I did

I think I followed the slide above solidly.

First, I calculated prior, mean, covar. 

As for prior vector by counting # of y for each class and divide them the total # of data

As for mean vector, I made an indicator function which returns 1 if two parameters are same, else 0, and for each class of y and for each item of X_train, which is each observation, I summed up the product of X_train and indicator fuction and divide it by # of y in that class.

As for covar matrix, it's too long to explain everything but I checked if it's positive definite and a square matrix.

And now I have 10 prior vectors, 10 mean vectors, and 10 covar matrices. For each item in X_test, and for each class, I calculated the product of prior and likelihood as written at the end of the slide above. So I get 10 posteriors for one test data. After I scaled it so that it would sum up to 1 by dividing all numbers with the largest number, I appended it to the result array and this is the result I'm supposed to submit. The result array is (# of test data) * (# of class) dimensional array.

I don't understand which step was wrong. I'm frustrated that it works perfectly on my PC but funny on Vocareum.

Please help me.

So let's denote the objective function as $\psi_{t} = \ln p(x|\theta_{1}) = \mathcal{L} + KL$, no $t$ subscript meaning we don't specify $q$. We can observe that $\psi$ is almost always negative as $0 \leq p \leq 1$.  As we know values $\mathcal{L}$ and $KL$ may differ as we plug in different distributions $q$ but they always sum up to $\psi$. Also $KL \geq 0$ implying  $\mathcal{L} \leq \psi \leq 0$. In E-step we smartly choose $q:=q_{t}(\theta_{2}) = p (\theta_{2} | x, \theta_{1}^{t})$ so that $KL=0$ and $\mathcal{L}_{t} = \psi_{t}$ and then we maximize $\mathcal{L}$ over $\theta_{1}$ which yields a new $\theta_{1}^{t+1}$.  And here the whole magic comes: we can use this new $\theta_{1}^{t+1}$ in $KL$ to make it positive which shows how $\psi_{t+1}$ increases and allows for next iteration of EM.



The optimization algos I've seen so far in the lectures were more or less ""self-evident"". But there is a true beauty and ""woow"" in this one. The $\psi = \mathcal{L} + KL$ seems the main hack here. I would love to know - from the more general approach - how one could eventually come up with such idea.",Micsza,,michal.szafraniuk@gmail.com,,,,CSMM102,106/discussion/9248,verified,

Well, a nice observation on the algo. part.

However, as I infer, from the given illustration, the ψ is getting expressed in a linear form (the basic/ simplistic / most common one, perhaps) as I can see the equation 

 ψ=L+KL is similar to y = mx + c (or ax + b) form, though I confess, my understanding here is limited/wrong or I have digressed too far.

The objective function $\psi = \ln p(x|\theta_{1})$ is a function of data $x$ and parameters (here represented by $\theta_{1}$). And it is defo not linear with respect to these arguments.

The trick is that the EM decomposition is smart in the sense that it allows iterative EM algorithm to work (monotonically improve $\psi$).

The technique of picking  a random value in the range of possible values for each parameter in a n x d vector is the method I chose.

However, when I go into the EMGMM algorithm and try to calculate the Bayes Estimator in the E-Step, my x - mean vector has such a great difference that it's driving my exponent to a very very small negative number (let's say -200000), which essentially makes each estimator 0.

I get when it's small, and your normalize it, it would mitigate it.  But Python can't even handle the decimal range it is returning.  

Any advice what I did wrong here?

Thanks for a great course, to start with!

This is mostly a question for the staff: For Project 4, I find the grading very difficult to understand. A couple of days ago, I submitted code that I knew would only do the U and V matrices (I set L to zeros, this was my 5th submission if you want to check it out). I was really surprised when I got 15/15 for the objective function (which I knew was obviously wrong) and 0/10 for the user-object locations (which I at least hoped would be correct). I drew the conclusion that the labels had been switched and thought no more of it until today.

Today I added code for calculating the objective L, without changing the previous code. Strangely,  I now got 8.27/15 on the objective function and 9.99999.../10 on the user-object locations. By deliberately making an error in the calculation of the objective function, I saw that the grade dropped from 8.27/15 to 7.65/15, which, contrary to what I thought previously, seems to imply that the labeling is fine. To summarize, this raises the following questions:



 How was it possible to get 15/15 for just setting L = 0 yesterday, and 8.27/15 when I tried to calculate it correctly today?

Why did I get 0/10 for V and U yesterday, and 9.99999.../10 today for the same code?

Finally, as others have asked, will we get a bonus for submitting before Nov 24? I did not get any bonus points.

Hope you have time to look into this!

Finding the  Determinant,Projects,Project 3,0,False,2019-11-28T16:27:33.631864+11:00,"So I think I'm running into a precision error issue. I have my code and algorithm structured properly (I think) and it runs with no issue on my machine.

However, when I upload it into the grading script, it's tripping an error in my numpy function to calculate the determinant.  Below is the error.  Digging into this, it looks like whatever the determinant I am calculating goes out to very small number, thus very precise and causing issues in the calculations.  I believe Python is just defaulting this to nan, which is causing calculation issues later on in my code.


Anyone else experience this? Or do you think there is something wrong somehwere else in my algorithm?  Variance, mean, etc...

I just cannot fully understand the meaning of saying we are to find the minimum of $\frac{1}{2}\|w\|^2$ for $w$ and $\mathbf{w_0}$, when clearly $\frac{1}{2}\|w\|^2$ is independent of $w_0$.

Obviously that has an impact in the usual way we perform Lagrange multipliers, nonetheless. Is this minimisation problem then probably some sort of ""virtual"" problem that simply provides the solution we're after (which perhaps doesn't have a fully clear meaning)?

 I am calculating the asked result:

with $$p(X=4)=p(X=4|Y=yes)+p(X=4|Y=no)$$

I understand given the nature of the two distributions (X being continuous, and Y being discrete), the way Bayes theorem works is such that $p(\cdot)$ and $P(\cdot)$ represents density and probability functions for $X$ and $Y$, respectively. The densities are given according to the question by:

$$p(X=4|Y=yes)=f(X=4; \mu=10, \sigma^2=36)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}}\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{(4-10)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

$$p(X=4|Y=no)=f(X=4; \mu=0, \sigma^2=36)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}}\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{(4-0)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

Hello! I enrolled in this course late. I'm currently finishing Week 6. Still, I don't think I will be able to do all the works by Dec 8th. I would like to ask you a favor to extend the deadline for lecture quizzes and projects.

I acknowledge that those who have done the works in time must be appreciated. However, the fact that I can't participate in this course regularly just because I found this course a little late makes me sad. I'm especially so since I desperately need the certificate from this course in my situation.

Just one-week extension of the deadline for quizzes and projects, so that it's the same as the deadline for the final exam--Dec 16th, would be extremely helpful for someone like me. This way, the entire course doesn't have to be delayed, so it wouldn't sacrifice anybody.

2) I ran the script on a local environment and it outputted the required objective.csv, U-10, U-25, U-50, V-10, V-25 and V-50 csv files; so I can't understand why it was unable to open the objective.csv file. However, I note that the numpy array, L, being saved to the objective.csv file is of shape (50, ). Do I need to make it shape(50, 1)? Where 50 refers to number of iterations

Creating a ratings matrix M from training data - error message

I googled the error message and the only issue I can think it might be is that I am creating an empty ratings matrix M, using a numpy array of shape (no. users, no.  objects); and then using for loops over users and objects to populate the empty matrix with elements from the last column of the training data (i.e. ratings). 

Is it because M[i, j] should be an element (i.e. a float)?

Whereas the Boolean array indexing I am using to set M[i, j] gives a shape (1, ) numpy array i.e. train_data[(train_data[:, 0] == i + 1) & (train_data[:, 1] == j + 1)][:, 2]?

Correction

I have tried to correct this using appending .item() to the Boolean array indexing so appending to M[i, j] = train_data[(train_data[:, 0] == i + 1) & (train_data[:, 1] == j + 1)][:, 2].item()

But then I get the error message:

""M[i, j] = train_data[(train_data[:, 0] == i + 1) & (train_data[:, 1] == j + 1)][:, 2].item()

I think for some indices i and j, there is no corresponding element found in train_data, so 

train_data[(train_data[:, 0] == i + 1) & (train_data[:, 1] == j+1)] 


returns:

array([], shape=(0, 3), dtype=float64)


which is not a scalar.  Can you try accounting for this condition?

Thank you for the assistance - it enabled me to debug my algorithm and get the mark I was hoping to get. 

In the synthetic dataset I generated, I did not allow for the possibility that in the ratings.csv file, there would not only be blank (imported into numpy as ""nan"") values for ratings in column 3, but that there may exist blank values for user_index and object_index in column 1 and column 2 - my assumptions above about the ratings.csv file were incorrect.

This is indirectly alluded to in Q3 of the Week 11 Project Implementation FAQs:

""Q3: How to deal with the situation that several rows or columns are totally unobserved?


You can assume there is no such edge case.""

Perhaps it might be worthwhile explicitly specifying in the FAQs that in ratings.csv, there will be some values of user_index and object_index that are blank, not just ratings for the benefit of current and future course members?

    OSError: temp16523.csv not found.  
    




I am not sure what's causing this, any thoughts will be appreciated!

Also I am not sure if I am doing this the right way, and if that is the reason caused the error message, here is what I tried to follow in the project:

1. divide X_train based on y value into 10 arrays;

2. calculate the 
    $$\hat{\mu}_y$$

and the 

for each y value (0 to 9) in the above slide with data from X_train

3. calculate the last line in the slide with X_test data, it will return 10  1x10 array, then I combine them as an 10x10 array P, then return P;



Any comments will be appreciated!



Thanks,

Jingyi

Isn't it true that, yes, Kernel PCA must project data into a lower dimensional space than that of the original data, finally -- even if the kernel is implicitly mapping it into a higher dimensional space as an intermediate step? Isn't that the whole point of PCA?

In ML, kernels allow us to implicitly apply non-linear transformations to the original data (in particular, when these transformations are defined with some specific convenient forms, the ""kernel trick"" can be applied which simplifies the calculations).

The forward-backward algorithm is a procedure to estimate the probability of observing all the $x_t$'s (the forward part does the work from $x_1,..,x_t$ and the backward part from $x_t,...,x_T$). From these probabilities, it can also provide an estimate of the state probability at time $t$:  $p(s_t = k | x_1,...,x_T)$, by Bayes Rule. However, this is only the most likely state at that time instance $t$,  there is no guarantee that the resulting state sequence is most likely or even possible given the transition probabilities.

The Viterbi algorithm does not use the forward-backward algorithm above, but it does have some rough resemblance to the forward algorithm. Viterbi algorithm finds the best entire sequence of states $s_1,...,s_T$. Technically, the algorithm works in a forward-recursive manner by maximizing over sequences of previous states explicitly. Hence it delivers an entire state sequence that is most likely.

I totally understand the situation. However, this course is instructor paced, we cannot grant any deadline extensions. It is also a way to ensure fairness for all the learners who have enrolled in this course. Please note that the videos are still accessible and you can still learn the course materials after the deadline. The course will be offered again in Feb and you may enroll at that time. Please do keep in mind that, you still need to pay the enrollment fee to become certified learners for the next run, but the good news is that the course will be slightly cheaper.

My query is that the slides state that EM is used in this context due to the intractability of the (log)-marginal distribution of the data (xi), presumably meaning that no closed-form analytic solutions can be found. 

That is not consistent with what I have read in ""Probabilistic Principal Components Analysis"", Tipping and Bishop (1999b) and also the paragraph containing equation (12.45) in section 12.2.1 ""Maximum likelihood PCA"" on p574 of PRML by Bishop. Have reproduced the relevant section of the paper here, and it is echoed in the book too:

 

Both sources (paper and PRML pages) explicitly show closed form solutions for W_ml, and it appears use of EM algorithm is an option rather than a strategy for overcoming intractability? Is the claim the slide makes purely a pedagogical simplification then?

The reason why your ticket is still pending could be due to the ID verification process. I know that it could take up to 3 business days but it seems that it has been a while.

I am sorry for the delay. Usually, the score would show up immediately after you take the final exam. However, if there is any of the following issues, you will have to wait for the investigation and review. 1. Any suspicious behavior during the proctored exam 2. ID verification issue.

Due to the huge inquiries of proctored exam complication and postponing of the exam, I believe reviewing of the disputed exam has been taken longer than expected. Besides, the offices were closed for holiday. I believe I can help to get hold of your case in a day or two by reaching out of to edx. Please note all customer support is still on going even after the course close. Please do not worry. Thank you for your patience.

Due to the complication of the proctoring software, the course staff decided to extend the course due date until December 23rd, 2019, 23:30 UTC to let you take (or retake) the proctored final exam. Before you proceed, please make sure you follow these steps before you take the final exam:



Take the practice proctored exam to verify your system compatibility



Use your edX credential to log-in for the final proctored exam



If you use other 3rd party (i.e. facebook or google account) login, you will not be able to access to the final exam. 



Close all other tabs, communication apps or any add-on software (i.e. Skype or Messenger) to prevent any pop-up message which could result in your exam flagged as violating the proctor exam rules. 



There can be many background data using apps you have installed on personal laptops, or network blocking security systems in corporate computers. Each of these can make PSI flag your exam. Therefore, the simpler the computer used, the better. An option is to log in as a ‘guest’ user on your computers (but then, this depends on if you downloaded PSI under all users or your admin account).

If your exam gets locked out or blocked, note that the timer still runs. When it ends, your exam will be submitted for you. We understand this is an issue, and the best resolution is to contact info@edx.org to reset your exam and report this on the discussion forum. PSI cannot reset exams, but they can determine why you were logged out. 


We are here to assist you if you have any other questions.

I've also got an e-mail from Software Secure (Your recent Remote Proctor exam Final Exam for edX requires further information). I submitted new photos successfully within 27 min of receiving the e-mail. That was 24 h ago, but I still haven't heard from them. I e-mailed EdX-support about this issue 12 h ago but haven't got an answer from them either. This morning I re-submitted the ID-photo once more.This is really frustrating and I don't seem to be the only one not receiving any information. 

A question to staff: given that so many of us seem to have issues that clearly have to do with software, have you considered helping out by contacting the people at Software Secure directly concerning the individual cases that you know of? As someone wrote, this course is quite expensive and it is a pity that software issues should destroy the overall excellent impression about the course. 

If the software continues to malfunction, I'd be happy to send my ID-photo to the course staff directly for verification. It is almost comical that the facial recognition system for a machine learning course seems to malfunction. However, it is not rocket science for a human to recognize a face.

We will use Ed for course discussion this term.

If you have any course related questions, you can reach out to your cohorts and course staff here. To help you have a successful experience in learning, we strongly encourage you actively participating in the discussion forum. You can ask questions, read and reply others' posts to benefit your learning. Before you start, we have a few tips for you: 



Ask questions that everyone can benefit from.

Answer any question you feel confident answering.

Share interesting course-related content with staff and your peers.

Announcements may also be made on Ed Discussion so make sure you regularly keep your eye out for those. You may also be notified via email for important announcements.

The discussion forums are a way for you to share your thoughts about course material, learn from your fellow students, get to know them better, and report problems.
If you have an urgent matter -- such as needing to report a video or other course component that isn't working properly -- you can get the attention of course staff by creating a new post and putting [STAFF] in the title.
 
There are a few other ways you can participate:
 
Select the ""heart"" icon to like  posts and good responses (so the post will move closer to the top of the discussion thread)
 
Select the “star” icon to follow posts for updates
 
Use “watch” to be notified of all activities in the thread
 
You are part of a diverse learning community that forms the heart of a meaningful learning experience. Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:
Be respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.
Be constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.
 
Be sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.
 
Post appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.
 
Users that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.
 
Please help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.
 
In addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!

FORUM POSTING GUIDELINES

What makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:
 
Read before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.
 
Use informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.
 
Make it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.
 
Stay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.
 
Help keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff. 
 
Thanks for keeping the conversation lively and respectful!",Susan,admin,xc2496@tc.columbia.edu,,,,CSMM103,98/discussion/1091,audit,

I have been steadily been working my way through the course and noticed that the tabs for the Discussion Forum in each weekly section of the course will not mark as completed. Usually I click the link to the Discussion Forum on the problematic tab, navigate to some other section of the edstem forum, and then click the next button on Edx site which continues into the next weeks content.

However, for all weekly sections, each Discussion Forum tab will not mark as complete. As a result, I cannot get any of the weekly sections to show as complete on the course overview.

This is a minor annoyance to as it does not affect any of the content of the course or my ability to complete it; but I such do miss the small hits of endorphins for completing sections and watching that satisfying green checkmark show up!

These materials are currently only available to students who have purchased the verified certificate. When you become a verified learner you will gain access to the projects, which include a built-in Python environment for you to learn and program in the Robot Operating System (ROS). ROS is an important skill in robotics and is widely used in robotics research to test and simulate robotics concepts before applying them to a real robot. The Projects in this course are aimed at applying the knowledge learned in the lectures and providing a hands-on experience with ROS.

You can learn the basic concepts of Robotics by watching the videos. However, doing the project allows you to apply the concept into practice. Yes, you might be frustrated during the process because there will be a lot of trials and errors. As an experienced learner, I found it extremely rewarding to see the visualization of the Robot movement.

More benefits about earning a certificate:

Official and Verified: Receive an instructor-signed certificate with the institution's logo to verify your achievement and increase your job prospects

Easily Shareable: Add the certificate to your CV or resume, or post it directly on LinkedIn

In my view, they are not the same. Mechatronics is a combination of Mechanical, Electrical, Computer Science, Control, Embedded, etc. Robotics is quite similar since it also covers these fields. Some people say that the inputs of a mechatronics system are provided, while the inputs of a robotics system is obtained by itself. That is to say, the main difference between Robotics & Mechatronics is autonomous or automatic.

Mechatronics = ""let's unify engineering to design and manufacture things better""

""Robotics"" (which began in ancient times in China and Greece) is older and more specific than ""Mechatronics"" (an idea put forth in 1971 by the Japanese).

Robotics is the core of ""Mechatronics"". Robots are the most important mechatronical systems, but anything that combines electronics, mechanical parts, computer code, networking, computer-assisted design, etc. in a unified way can be said to be ""mechatronics"". 



""Mechatronics"" is more like a mind-set or a design principle, it's the idea that we should try and mix things up to see what clever technology we can cook up in the mix. In the worst case, it's just an umbrella term for almost all branches of modern engineering, and one may be tempted to know it all without really knowing anything. But in the best case it is a call for experts in different fields to share their knowledge and cooperate in innovative ways. 

Robotics has more of a specific goal: to make machines that can think and operate in the physical world the same as humans or even better, to hopefully benefit our lives. Robotics is the best example of ""mechatronics"", but it benefits from having a solid history and a clear aim.

In the end, all robotics engineers must have the ""mechatronics mindset"", especially in the hyper-connected world of today, and anyone who cares about ""mechatronics"" should really get comfortable building robots.

Peace!

You should be able to run most of the project scripts locally with Melodic, but since they are designed for Kinetic there may be some version differences that require small changes to the code. I recommend you take note of any changes you make, as you will need to have it working with Kinetic on Vocareum for submission.

I just did Project1 but was running into an issue I hadn't seen before. I submitted it and the submission report said my implementation was correct, but I was never able to see the data published to the /sum topic correctly. I checked that the /two_ints topic was being published to correctly with rostopic echo /two_ints, and that was being published to as expected. i had print statements that confirmed my subscription callback was being executed as expected, and that the sum was being calculated correctly. When launching the solution node, rostopic list was showing the /sum topic. However, when I echoed it, there was no data coming through. i used rostopic info /sum and confirmed that the solution node was subscribing to it, and I confirmed through rosptopic info /two_ints that the topic had the publisher and subscriber as the two_ints_talker and solution nodes, respectively.



I'm not sure what could have caused this, but I know that having the workspace hosted through Vocaerum could possibly make networking and ROS a little more tricky. Like I said, I got the 5/5, so I'm not concerned about it, but I am curious if I could fix this for the future.

If you are working on the skeleton code we provide, you will see that the messages published are defined as 'geometry_msgs.msg.TransformStamped()'.

I believe you've got the right ideal. However, when you calculate V3, you can't just subtract two position vector. You should start with the position of camera, inverse it and trace back to base or robot, and the use the position of object in base frame or robot frame, to get the difference.

We have received questions about whether you could take four courses at once to earn the MicroMasters degree.


The answer is yes, but a few things to keep in mind:



A workload consisting of four courses is the same as a full-time student, so you would need to budget your time accordingly.

The time you need to dedicate weekly for each course will depend on your previous knowledge on programming, calculus, linear algebra, and probability. Please refer below for the prerequisites for each course.

Although you could take all courses at once, there is a natural progression in the MicroMasters courses: AI goes well with ML, Robotics with Animation.


For students who are eager to complete the MicroMasters, we recommend you to take a combination of AI and ML in one session and Robotics and Animation and CGI in another because AI introduces some concepts that will be featured in ML while Robotic tends to have a lighter course load compared to the heavy course load in Animation and CGI, which serves as a great complement. Each course is offered twice a year, once in the Fall (Sep-Dec) and once in the Spring (Feb-May).


Here is a breakdown of prerequisites for each course:



AI: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, derivatives), Calculus, Basic probability theory, Python programming

ML: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, derivatives), Calculus, Basic probability theory, Python programming

Robotics: Linear algebra, Knowledge of Linux environment, Python

Animation and CGI:  Multi-variable calculus, linear algebra, C++, knowledge to navigate a large codebase


No matter which study path you choose, rest assured that there will be plenty of learning materials and your course staff and classmates will be very willing to help!

I welcome very much your idea to expose audit learnes to ROS. From my experience (I hope I'm not the only one), someone completely new to ROS might not be familiar with Ubuntu. I've been trying to use ROS via Ubuntu+WSL and I haven't managed to run ROS without problems. Not being able to experience ROS properly can discourage audit learners (who are potential customers) to continue with the course. 

Having access to the Vocareum to be able to use a correct setupt and environment of ROS from the beginning would be very much appreciated. Some small tasks to help us start applying the concepts from the lessons would also be very useful. Only once I have ""tasted"" this part of the course, can I decide if I think that for me it's worth the price for the full course.

I would also be willing to pay a fraction of the price for this priviliges (in case there is a capacity limit for the Vocareum server, and you can't offer it to unlimited people).

I am stuck with the last part of the assignment, I have passed the other tests except for the camera aiming. I was able to achieve what is attached here which seems very close but not exactly. What I did is:



I got the vector going from base to camera location by transforming the camera translation vector from the robot coordinate frame to the base coordinate frame.



I got the directional vector from camera to object in Base coordinate frame by subtracting the vector camera to object from vector base to object all with respect to base frame.

I transformed the directional vector from camera to object from the base coordinate frame to robot coordinate frame by inversing the transformation from base to robot and multiply it by the vector. 

I got the angle between that vector and the x (1,0,0) in the robot frame through the dot product.

Got the axis by cross product of the same vectors.



I have read in earlier posts that the dot and cross product operations should be done in the camera frame not the robot frame but I can't understand how to do this because the transformation between the robot frame to the camera frame is not actually known until we deduce the axis and angle except. The only part that is known out of this transformation is the translation part only as per the project inputs.

For the transform from the 'robot' coordinate frame to the 'camera' coordinate frame, you can regard it to have the translation first and then the rotation. The rotation part will not change the origin of the 'camera' coordinate. 

Therefore, you can get the real x-axis(the vector from the origin of 'camera' coordinate to the origin of 'object' coordinate) of the 'camera' coordinate before rotation, which means you can use the transform matrix from 'robot' frame to 'camera' frame that only has the translation part. 

Then you can compute the transform matrix from 'camera' frame to 'object' frame and get the direction.

I looked through your last submission and I see that you understand the concept well, but I noticed a very small mistake that is causing the issue. When you multiply a transformation by a coordinate vector, you will correctly receive that vector expressed in the new coordinate system. However, when performing this operation on a distance vector, the distance between the two points is not necessarily preserved! If there is any translation component in the transformation, it will stretch or shrink the vector and the result will not be what you expect.

Please let me know if you need further clarification.

No problem! The vector I was referring to is your camera-to-object vector. When you transform the vector from the base frame to the robot frame, you are actually changing the length of this vector. There are two ways to fix this: you can either perform a rotation-only transformation on the vector, or you can create the camera-to-object vector in the robot frame (and skip the transformation).

Please let me know if you have any trouble!

Start with a lot simpler transform and rotations until you understand what is going on



I placed object at 0,0,5

robot at 0,0,2

and camera at 0,0,1 (from robot)

No rotations

Then it is pretty easy to identify errors in the math e.g. vector from cam to object must be 0,0,2 in cam space

After you get camera to point up to object, you can do 90 degree rotation of robot around z, and check if it still works

Then just plug in correct project 2 values and you should have your result

https://us.edstem.org/courses/98/discussion/5584,question,Incorrect answers in section 5.4?,Lectures,,0,False,2019-10-18T02:53:58.812209+11:00,"I was double-checking the results in section 5.4 (Singularities) for my own review. In the lecture video, it showed that$$\Delta q_2 = \frac{\Delta x - \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2} \Delta y}{-\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2} c_1 + s_1}$$

when $q_2$ is very close to $\pi$. However, I seem to be getting a positive coefficient for $c_1$ when I go through the calculations. Am I doing something incorrectly? Here are the steps I have:

1. Create the system of equations.

$\varepsilon_1 \Delta q_1 + s_1 \Delta q_2 = \Delta x$

$\varepsilon_2 \Delta q_1 - c_1 \Delta q_2 = \Delta y$

2. Rewrite the second equation to solve $\Delta q_1$ in terms of $\Delta q_2$. Incidentally, this is the same answer as in the video.

$\Delta q_1 = \frac{\Delta y + c_1 \Delta q_2}{\varepsilon_2}$

3. Rewrite the first equation to solve $\Delta q_2$ in terms of $\Delta q_1$.

$\Delta q_2 = \frac{\Delta x - \varepsilon_1 \Delta q_1}{s_1}$

4. Plug in $\Delta q_1$ from previous step.

$\Delta q_2 = \frac{\Delta x - \varepsilon_1 \left( \frac{\Delta y + c_1 \Delta q_2}{\varepsilon_2} \right)}{s_1} = \frac{\Delta x - \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2} \Delta y - \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2} c_1 \Delta q_2}{s_1}$

5. Solve for $\Delta q_2$ by moving the $\Delta q_2$ term to the left side and simplifying.

$\Delta q_2 + \frac{\varepsilon_1 c_1}{\varepsilon_2 s_1} \Delta q_2 = \frac{\Delta x - \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2} \Delta y}{s_1}$

$\left( \frac{\varepsilon_2 s_1 + \varepsilon_1 c_1}{\varepsilon_2 s_1} \right) \Delta q_2 = \frac{\Delta x - \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2} \Delta y}{s_1}$

6. Divide both sides by the coefficient and simplify.

$\Delta q_2 = \frac{\Delta x - \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2} \Delta y}{s_1} \cdot \frac{\varepsilon_2 s_1}{\varepsilon_2 s_1 + \varepsilon_1 c_1} = \frac{\Delta x - \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2} \Delta y}{1} \cdot \frac{\varepsilon_2}{\varepsilon_2 s_1 + \varepsilon_1 c_1} \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{\varepsilon_2}}{\frac{1}{\varepsilon_2}} = \frac{\Delta x - \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2} \Delta y}{s_1 + \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2} c_1}$



Also, I'm not sure how the result $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y} = \frac{c_1}{s_1}$ is obtained when $q_2 = 0$. Doing my own calculations, I get a different answer:

1. Create the system of equations.

$-2 s_1 \Delta q_1 - s_1 \Delta q_2 = \Delta x$

$2 c_1 \Delta q_1 + c_1 \Delta q_2 = \Delta y$

2. Solve for $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}$.

$\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y} = \frac{-2 s_1 \Delta q_1 - s_1 \Delta q_2}{2 c_1 \Delta q_1 + c_1 \Delta q_2} = \frac{-s_1 (2 \Delta q_1 + \Delta q_2)}{c_1 (2 \Delta q_1 + \Delta q_2)} = -\frac{s_1}{c_1}$

As far as my understanding of trigonometry goes, $-\frac{s_1}{c_1}$ is not equal to $\frac{c_1}{s_1}$.",Khung314,,khung@nullaxiom.com,,,,CSMM103,98/discussion/5584,verified,

Projects 3 and 4 introduce you to the Kuka lightweight robot arm, a uniquely jointed robot that offers a lot of freedom in the position and rotation of its end-effector within its work space. In Project 3, you are tasked with directly controlling the joint angles using forward kinematics to move the robot between two configurations, while Project 4 uses inverse kinematics and Cartesian control to set the joint angles so that the desired end-effector configuration can be reached.

Just recently in Melbourne, Australia, they started using a similar Kuka robot to scoop ice cream! Here is a video of the robot in action. While watching the video, think about the concepts you learned in this course related to the movement and control of a robot arm.

The first thing you should do is confirm that your determinant from Question 3 is correct. Then for Question 4 you can either directly plug in the values or, as you mention, you can break it up into cases that would make the whole determinant equal to zero. Also, if the determinant does not contain one of the angles, you can disregard the value of that angle as it is not affecting the outcome.

Finally, remember that even if your answer is marked as incorrect that doesn't mean your selections are wrong. This is a ""select all"" question so it's possible that there are more correct answers that you need to select.

Hopefully I was able to help!

After looking through I believe these are all of the files you need to make the change on:

robot_sim_bringup.cpp

Additionally, you need to open catkin_ws/src/robot_sim/CMakeLists.txt and replace any references of kinetic to melodic.

The calculation for end effector velocity is flexible, but for this Project we recommend multiplying your change in position by a proportional gain, as follows:$$v_{ee}=P\Delta x$$

You can try different values of P to see what works best, I recommend to stay in the range of  0 < P < 10. Also, to avoid quick and jerky motions you might want to limit the maximum velocity that can be output. 

Once you have V-ee you can treat it as x dot when computing new joint velocities. Managing all the variables can get confusing so make sure to closely follow the algorithm steps listed on the Project page.

Please let me know if have any more questions.

One other question that I have is about the jacobian. I understand that we assemble the last column of the matrix that relates joint velocity to end effector velocities for our jacobian however I am confused about the reference frame. Since the joint transforms are the transform from the base to the joint would we need to multiply the inverse of that transform times the transform from the base to the end effector to get the transformation to the end effector from the joint. If yes then do we use the current transformation from the base to the ee or the desired?,Aryanpn,,aryanpn@gmail.com,Steven,admin,slm2242@columbia.edu,CSMM103,98/discussion/7852,verified,audit

Your explanation of the Jacobian procedure sounds correct.

For this calculation you should be using the current transformation. What you are trying to say with the equation is, starting at the current configuration, set the joint velocities to this q_dot vector in order to produce the desired v_ee for a small linear displacement. 

Hope this helps,

Are you accounting for small singular values in your pseudo-inverse matrix? It could also just be a small calculation mistake that is somehow inflating your distance error or output velocity. In this case I recommend printing out certain values that you have an idea of what they should be (delta_x, v_ee, desired - current, etc.) and see if they are different than what you would expect.

Additionally, if you submit your current code through Vocareum our team can view your submission and offer further assistance.

I think the idea is that, if you scale the unit vector defining the axis by the angle, then it's equivalent to the rotational component of each axis - again, not very intuitive.

A few other things that really tricked me:



The joint transforms are all in the base coordinate frame

To obtain the R matrix in the Jacobian section you use this with the current end effector transform to obtain the joint transform of interest. This is what you'll use for the translation and rotation bits of that joint's contribution to the jacobian.

Watch out for where things should be inverted!

Also, the delta X that we obtain doesn't need to be transformed by that 6x6 matrix described in the lecture notes. That one really messed up my results for a while. 

Also, the 0.1 m/s and 0.1 rad/s values mentioned in the description are a little slow, you'll want to increase those if you want the system to respond correctly

I really wish there was a bit more clarity given on this because I spent several days thinking I had good code and that it was just my tuning that was off - there are so many areas to make mistakes here and not a lot to go on to figure out where you might be going wrong :/

The link that Rnvandemark shared as well as the bullet points on the Project page are good resources to help you better understand the steps.

I would also like to add a few more specific tips:



When multiplying two transformations, you'll want to have the same term in the middle. This will give you the transformation between the leftmost term to the rightmost term.

When you extract a rotation from a transformation matrix you'll get both the angles and the rotation axis. Both of these components are needed to calculate the rotation values for Vee. This post by another learner provides some insight into this as well as some other tips that may help.

After you create Vee you may need to limit the maximum magnitude that it can output. This will prevent quick jerky of the robot.

The joint_transforms list only contains the joints between the base and the end effector, and not the end effector itself. For base to end effector transformations you should only use what is provided at the top of the function.

Hopefully these tips will help you move forward with the Project, good luck!

If you want the transformation a_T_c you could multiply a_T_b * b_T_c. In this case 'b' is the middle term that gets eliminated from the result and you get the relationship between 'a' and 'c'. It's important to make sure you follow this convention when you multiply two transformations. If you have b_T_a instead of a_T_b, you can take the matrix inverse in order to get a_T_b.

Check your matrix multiplications to make sure they follow this rule, and let me know if you have any more questions.

https://us.edstem.org/courses/98/discussion/9022,question,Question about the calculation of delta x and velocity in cartesian space,Assignments,Project 4,0,False,2019-11-15T03:23:53.6778+11:00,"Hi,

I have a question about the methods of obtaining$$\Delta x\ \text{and similarly}\ \nu_{ee}.$$

Following from Section 7.4: Putting It All Together of the notes (and also 7.1), it would seem that Δx should be a 6x1 vector containing the cartesian translation and rotation values for the end-effector. Now, given current and desired transforms from the {b} to {ee}, how do we obtain Δx? I want to make the distinction that, per the lectures, Δx should be in the frame of the base coordinate and not the end-effector. Then, v_ee should be in the frame of the end-effector. So, how do we compute these values?

One option would be to compute the translation component of Δx as $$\Delta x\ \textrm{translation: } ^bT_{ee,desired}[:-1,-1] \textrm{  } - \textrm{  } ^bT_{ee,current}[:-1,-1] \textrm{  ,}$$

and then calculate the rotation component of Δx using the method from Project 2. [i.e. Compute the axis-angle representations of the current and desired rotations from the given transforms. Then determine the angle around an axis in the base frame {b} needed to get this desired change by using the cross product and dot product between these two rotation axes.] With both components obtained, separate proportionality factors can be applied for thresholding, giving $$\dot{x} = p \cdot \Delta x \textrm{ .}$$

Then, to determine dx in the frame of the end-effector, calculate $$v_{ee}=\left[\begin{matrix}^{ee}R_b&0\\0&^{ee}R_b\end{matrix}\right]\cdot\dot{x}\text{ ,}$$

using the rotation component of $$^bT_{ee,current}^{-1} \textrm{ to obtain } ^{ee}R_b \textrm{ .}$$

This can then be used to determine the joint velocities necessary to move the robot arm using the Jacobian and it's pseudo-inverse.QUESTION: should the rotation component used above be from the current transformation (as shown above), or should it come from the desired transformation of the end-effector?



Option two, however, seems like the more obvious method to compute the transform from the current pose of the end-effector to its desired pose using$$^{ee,current}T_{ee,desired}=^bT_{ee,current}^{-1}\cdot^bT_{ee,desired} \textrm{  ,}$$

which is in the frame of the end-effector automatically; this gives a 4x4 transformation matrix. This then skips the conversion from $$\Delta x\ \ \ \longrightarrow\ \ \ \dot{x}$$

as we are already in the end-effector frame {ee}. Then, the translation component of dx can be read directly from this. The rotation component of dx can be computed in euler angles from the rotation component of this transform using tf.transformations.euler_from_matrix

from the TF library and similar calls from previous projects. With these values obtained, one can then apply separate proportionality factors to meet threshold requirements for the translation and rotation parts to give final value v_ee.





I have tried implementing both methods and appear to be getting eradicate behavior of the robot arm - even with valid matrix values for transforms and the Jacobian - and it does not follow the cartesian control asked for. It is possible that my thresholding is too low/too high, but I think it might be something wrong with my understanding of calculating v_ee.

Are either of the above two methods correct or is my understanding flawed in some capacity?



Thank you for any input and help with my understanding.

Sincerely,

Michael

This would give you the ""opposite"" vector that your intuition would give. If that is what you meant, make sure your calculations take that into account.


For the rotation component, you can just subtract the Euler angles of the two matrices for easier calculation. To get the Euler angles of each matrix, you can use tf.transformations.euler_from_matrix().



When you're calculating $v_{ee}$ using the rotation matrix, you're rotating the velocity from the base coordinate frame to the current end-effector coordinate frame. I like to think of it as caring about what we want the current coordinate frame's velocity to be, not about our desired coordinate frame's velocity. The current velocity will determine what our future position will be, so it makes sense (to me) that we are operating in that coordinate frame.

This has been raised before but I don't see a definitive answer from the staff. It is extremely hard to debug project 5 because of the apparent randomness of the grader. Sometimes, when running it, I get all points reached, sometimes it times out. 

Is the grader always using the same point and obstacle positions? if yes, I would expect the points to be successfully reached 100% of the time.

Also, when I tried to submit (after successfully running the local grader) my solution, I got an exception that basically means a path to the goal wasn't found. Is the grader explicitly testing for this specific case? if yes, what should the function return? My solution currently has a limit on the time it runs (200 seconds) and the number of nodes it produces before it finds a solution. 

I would appreciate any help.

Best,

The randomness isn't with the grader, but with the algorithm itself. The RRT algorithm relies on random selection of points, so sometimes the tree it builds might not find the goal. I found I was able to improve the rate at which the algorithm found a solution on time by playing with the distance the tree extends towards each random point and the density of points to sample on each new line when checking a new node for validity. Hope this helps!

thanks for the suggestion - that's exactly what I am doing now after reading the grader source code. Indeed, the algorithm randomly chooses different points but without any constraints in place (time or number of nodes), which I tried, I was getting ""Ik failed"" occasionally but not always, which was kinda confusing to me. I would think that allowing the algorithm to run ""forever"" would eventually reach a solution. Anyways, I think I am on the right track now - I have to improve the way I am computing the points in a given path (discretization).

It seems you are not sending information to all joints of the robot. Keep in mind that the joint_transforms list does not contain the end effector transform since that is provided separately.

The end effector is a result of all joint transformations along the arm. Therefore you need to use every element in the joint_transforms list when forming your Jacobian. Your robot is fixed because the last element is not used, and so the associated dq defaults to zero.

I would like to ask also for some future recommendation to learn more advanced topics in ROS and its associated packages like moveit. Is there by any chance a good book that includes examples and projects  that I can work on? Most of the online tutorials seem very superficial and act as an introduction to the concepts but in order to gain real experience, I need to move through examples and work on several projects like the ones we had in this course. Please let me know if you have some recommendations for me.

Hope you are doing well so far in the course.
We noticed that there are some students having problems with the proctored exam code. If you are a verified track student, you need to do the practice proctored exam first to ensure the compatibility of your computer in preparation  for your final exam. If you have a problem with the exam code, please reply to this thread, and we will contact you in person to provide assistance. Please complete the self- checking (via the practice proctored exam) and replying to this thread ASAP.
Please keep in mind that the final exam is only 10% of the total grade ; however, it is necessary to take the final exam to get the certification.

Thank you!
Yours,
Course Staff

Some students have reported issues while taking the Proctored Final Exam. We would like to address what you should do depending on your situation so that you can hopefully have your issue resolved.

If you cannot start the exam, due to either an invalid exam code or other issue with setting up the proctoring software, please contact edx support at info@edx.org explaining your issue.

If you experienced a crash while taking the exam and were unable to complete the exam, please reply to this thread and provide us with any details you can about the crash. Additionally, you can contact edx support at info@edx.org describing the issue.

If you completed the exam but have a concern, please reply to this thread explaining your concern.

You are part of a diverse learning community that forms the heart of a meaningful learning experience. Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:
Be respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.
Be constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.
 
Be sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.
 
Post appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.

FORUM POSTING GUIDELINES

What makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:
 
Read before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.
 
Use informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.
 
Make it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.
 
Stay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.
 
Help keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff.

I'm Huy Ha, a junior in Columbia studying CS, and I'll be one of your TAs for Computer Animation and CGI Motion this semester! Alhough the title of the course sounds very cute, you all may have realized by now that the material isn't as cuddly as it seemed. I took this course last year and I can tell you that it was one the hardest course I've ever took. I came into the class not knowing C++ or linear algebra, but thanks to the help of my TAs and my peers I was able to not only get through the class, but now I'm also here, TAing the course! Please try to create a community here in the discussion where everyone feels confident asking questions, and I hope you all try to help answer each other's questions. Here are a few tips and tricks from me, that I wish I knew when I started this course:




I highly recommend using Git. Sometimes (especially in future assignments) files can get so long and different classes can depend on each other so much that changing one line somewhere might cause you to fail the oracle. However, I must ask that if you plan to use it with GitHub to use private repos. The material in this course is dense and so we can't afford to come up with new content for every semester that comes along. If you post it on GitHub, future students might just stumble across it, and that will ruin their opportunity to learn by themselves.

Give yourself a lot of time to do the assignments. For some of you without a very strong math or physics background, staring at a 10 page prompt full of derivations and equations might seem intimidating. Start early, give yourself time for the material to sink in.


If you haven't already, you should familiarize yourself with the Eigen library. Some of the functions in there will make your code much easier to read and debug. Specifically, take a look at block functions, as you'll be using them the most.


Use the discussion board! If you don't understand a certain concept in the write up, please make a post on the discussion board. If you don't understand it on the write up, it will be that much harder when you're trying to debug.


In my opinion, one of the most useful resources we provide to get you started is the FAQ document. This is a collection of tips, tricks and other goodies picked up from the TAs experience for all the assignments. You can find the document at Course > Learning Materials > FAQ.

I'm Joshua Silva; I'm a Master's student at Cal Poly Pomona in Mathematics. My current interests are differential geometry and I'm particularly excited in this course for the opportunity to see this beautiful subject touch upon some practical applications in animation. Although my math background is solid, my programming background is not as strong and I'm feeling a little trepidation about my C++ skills. It was certainly a relief to see Huy mention that she started this class not knowing any C++ at all, and yet she still did well in the course and now is even a TA! So I'm cautiously optimistic that this course will turn out well.",Silvascientist,,silvascientist@gmail.com,Adam,admin,ycl2112@columbia.edu,CSMM104,102/discussion/1361,audit,audit

I am very glad that Huy can be an inspirational role for you and to many other students. Dr. Grinspun designed this course for anyone who is interested in Animation and CGI. If you dont know C++, it is still possible to catch up. All you need is to invest time. From what I know, while studying in Columbia, Huy can learn anything he wants and he can sit and study for over 10 hours to figure things out. He is never late for his assignment because as soon as he receivs an assignment, he would start working on it and get at least 50% done, then space his study time to tackle all the other homeworks. He explained, he would understand the complexity of the assignment and budget accuratley how much time he would need for the rest of the project. I hope you all can be inspired by Huy’ personal journal and study with us.

But what is required though is the addGradEToTotal() function in that SimpleGravityForce.cpp which is where you have to fill in the gradE vector that is passed into it as an argument with the gravity force for each particle/dof. Gravity I think needs to be calculated using mass (the m vector ) so you have to use the m_gravity member variable, turn it into a vector and combine it with the mass to get the right value of gravity per particle.



obviously I cant give you the code, but some really useful types and functions in Eigen are the Eigen::Map<MatrixXs> type which you can pass a vector.data() pointer in to wrap the vector into a different type and then perform operations on it as if it was that type.

In order to avoid sharing my code, here's what I'm doing in plain English: 



Create a zero vector - let's say we call it 'f'

Call on accumulateGradU with that vector 'f' as an argument (I understand that dx and dv are optional arguments). 

My expectation is that the vector f values will be filled with the force vector (in the case of simpleGravity it should be -9.81 in the y direction)

However, when I do a std::cout of f, all I see is a vector of zeros.

However, there are two parts in each frame:



The animation engine finds all forces in the scene, then fill in the GradE vector for all particles based on the implementation of those forces. (This is what accumulateGradU() does).

The animation engine then calls on the integrator to take the filled in GradE vector and integrate to the next frame's positions and velocities. 

Right now, you need to work on SimpleGravityForce's implementation before you see anything in the vector.",Huy,admin,hqh2101@columbia.edu,Leonardo1452,,vikram@ascendus.com,CSMM104,102/discussion/2088,audit,verified

 Why is it that in 'SimpleGravityForce::addGradEToTotal', the vector of velocities and positions are part of the input parameters?

Suppose that both points are moving only horizontally, with velocities v1=90 and v2=110; that is, both points are moving in the same general direction, but with different speeds.

The set up instructions can be found on the assignment page. Let me know if you have trouble finding it. Since this is just to set things up, you will only need to do this entire sequence of procedures once.

Afterwards, whenever you've made a change to the source code, you would go into your build folder (cd build) then type make which will look at all the files you've changed and recompile as necessary.

We have received many questions about whether you could take four courses at once to earn the MicroMasters degree.

The answer is yes, but a few things to keep in mind:

A workload consisting of four courses is the same as a full-time student, so you would need to budget your time accordingly.

The time you need to dedicate weekly for each course will depend on your previous knowledge on programming, calculus, linear algebra, and probability. Please refer below for the prerequisites for each course.

Although you could take all courses at once, there is a natural progression in the MicroMasters courses: AI goes well with ML, Robotics with Animation.

For students who are eager to complete the MicroMasters, we recommend you to take a combination of AI and ML in one session and Robotics and Animation and CGI in another because AI introduces some concepts that will be featured in ML while Robotic tends to have a lighter course load compared to the heavy course load in Animation and CGI, which serves as a great complement. Each course is offered twice a year, once in the Fall (Sep-Dec) and once in the Spring (Feb-May).

Here is a breakdown of prerequisites for each course:

AI: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, derivatives), Calculus, Basic probability theory, Python programming

ML: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, derivatives), Calculus, Basic probability theory, Python programming

Robotics: Linear algebra, Knowledge of Linux environment, Python

Animation and CGI:  Multi-variable calculus, linear algebra, C++, knowledge to navigate a large codebase

No matter which study path you choose, rest assured that there will be plenty of learning materials and your course staff and classmates will be very willing to help!



You can make any necessary changes pertaining to your class.

I think I am properly calculating the gradU for all the pieces, but when they are applied in the scene stepper the results are not what I am expecting.

1. In Spring tests my springs oscillates 100%. The particles begin to come together, then rather than slow and separate, they keep coming together, pass each other and keep going until they reach the other particles starting position. Then they begin heading back to their original position, and the oscillation continues like this (it doesn't blow up).

2. In Gravity tests it seems like the orbit is not strong enough and the arc is very large.

3. In damping the particles slows about half way to the line rather than reach it

Four things that I can think of: 

1. Are you checking if the particle is fixed (scene.isFixed(particleNumber))?

2. Are you indexing correctly (for example, if you have a position vector with two particles ...  to get to particle 1, you have to do index i and to get to particle 2, you have to do index i*2)?

3. Are you updating velocity first (get the velocity of n+1 from n) and then updating position (get position of n+1 using velocity of n+1)?

4. When you call on accumulateGradU, send in only the force vector (a vector of zeros) as a parameter.

On your first note, the pngs come out blank because you ran the simulation with the -d 0 flag. In order to get png outputs.

On your second note, unfortunately, this is the worst situation to be in :( When you pass all other tests, and then there's only one left that simply won't work, debugging it seems to be almost impossible without an oracle telling you where to look.

Fixed particles in the engine is more like particles that don't experience force. Therefore, you must zero out the forces acting on such a fixed particle before doing anything else. With that, retrace the logic of LinearizedImplicitEuler to see if you can find a better point to handle fixed particles!

I have a little question related to the quiz question about external forces applied on spring particles systems.

Suppose we have a spring with a stiffness of 5 connecting two particles p1 and p2 which lie on a horizontal line at  𝑥=0  and  𝑥=1 respectively. If an external force of 5N is applied uniformly on both particles, what is the magnitude of the spring force applied on  𝑝1 ?

It's a valid way to think that u need to apply an external force greater than the stiffness parameter to have an effect on the system? or the way to view this question is from an equilibrium perspective, I mean...if you have differential in the external forces applied to each particle you alter the potential energy, so if you apply the same force uniformly that doesn't alter the system.

If anyone gives feedback to my reasoning I appreciate!",Cristobal_alcazar,,alcazar.cristobal90@gmail.com,,,,CSMM104,102/discussion/4313,verified,

Therefore the displacement of the spring does not change. Therefore the spring's potential energy does not change. 

Note that if it is a non- uniform force field that you're applying to the system, it doesn't matter the magnitude of the force field. As long as the two particles have different accelerations, some spring force of equal magnitude and the opposite direction will be induced onto the particles. 

Therefore, I think the latter reasoning makes more sense!",Huy,admin,hqh2101@columbia.edu,Cristobal_alcazar,,alcazar.cristobal90@gmail.com,CSMM104,102/discussion/4313,audit,verified

Your code should be more likely to work in Debug mode than in Release mode, so that wasn't why.

A general debugging tip is if you have a test that is failing, try making a copy of it then slowly stripping away elements from the test until it succeeds. This decreases the complexity of the scene, so you know that if after you remove a feature from the scene and then scene works, then that feature's implementation in your code is not there yet.

Another way to debug is to change some parameters inside the scene, to see if that causes it to succeed. Usually, accumulation of tiny little errors in some pipeline in your engine would cause this, so you would track down how that parameter affects the flow of your program, then search for the bug there.",Huy,admin,hqh2101@columbia.edu,Mdieckmann,,markus.dieckmann@gmail.com,CSMM104,102/discussion/5387,audit,verified

I'm not sure what's SymPy so I'm trying to do it with Mathematica (but again, here also I don't have much exposure with Mathematica). 

Anyway, I've gotten to the point where I've got a really long expression in Mathematica containing sub-expressions that look like this: 

""(-dx1 t+dx2 t-X1+X2).(-dx2 t+dx3 t-X2+X3)"".

Huy and Jacob did offer some pointers for my other thread... unfortunately I'm still not able to make any headway. 

So here is where I am with regard to arriving at the coefficients of the quartic polynomial:

I have assigned A = X2(t)-X1(t) and B = X3(t)-X2(t) and worked through the algebra to get to an expression in A and B (and r1 and r2) . 

Now, when I take this expression, then replace A and B back with appropriate expressions in terms of x1, x2, dx1, dx2 etc. I get a working expression which produces results in Wolfram  that are comparable to the examples provided. Please see screenshot below. In order to comply with the spirit of the forum, I have blanked out portions of the expression.

My questions at this point are: 

1. How do I collect for the powers of t in Wolfram? As I understand it, I need to get to the coefficients of t^4, t^3, etc. The problem is that the dot products have got the scalar t embedded in them. So one cannot simply combine them. Doing ""Collect"" in Wolfram simply returns the same expression. It was also suggested that I treat the dot products as scalars and give them symbols like a, b, c etc. But what happens next? How do I proceed after that? The t symbols are still inside the dot products (see screenshot above).

2. It was suggested that I try SymPy. If I'm using SymPy how do I declare and use vectors symbolically? All the SymPy documentation I read suggested that the way to declare a vector is to use the Matrix class which requires you to provide elements inside the Matrix object that you create.  I could not find any way to declare a vector as a pure symbol (i.e. without allocating elements into the matrix).  

3. The SymPy article suggested in the FAQ is about gradient computation using SymPy. I'm not able to make the connection with the current problem at hand - which is to reduce an expression and get the coefficients of powers of t. How does this article tie-in with our current challenge?

Sorry for the late reply! I've written answers to your questions below --- hopefully they help clear any confusion.

1. ""Wrong polynomial degree"" indicates that the oracle is expecting a polynomial of the nth degree, but you provided a polynomial of a degree other than n 

(Note: Based on discussions from past year, it seems like numerical errors in the polynomial coefficients can also trigger this warning).

On the other hand, ""Wrong polynomial coefficients"" indicates that the coefficients in your derivation differ from the oracle's.

2. You do not need to use normals in your calculations / derivations

3. It seems that students from previous years also had a similar issue where their derivation yielded the correct results for the two sample cases, but failed the ContinuousTimeTests.

The issue seems to stem from the formula for the quartic position polynomial. For example, there seems to be a difference between $a \cdot (b+c+\cdots)$ vs  $a \cdot b + a \cdot c + \cdots$). Most likely, there is some floating point inprecision that can add up to exceed the oracle's allowed error threshold.

In cases like this, we would manually grade it. I've taken a look at your code and ran the tests.

Though Matthew did say it could be because of floating point differences in the other post, we won't know for sure until we go through your code.

Therefore, I've gone ahead and made this post private because this information will likely not apply to other students and I am revealing information about your peers (anonymous, but nonetheless, information) that is only necessary to assure you it's not the grader's problem.

Staff member Huy also mentioned that he used SymPy when he took this course. So now, after trying Mathematica (Wolfram Cloud) and not being fully satisfied with the results,  I'm making an attempt to use SymPy to generate my formulae. In this connection, I have the following questions: 



In the FAQ, there is a link to an article on SymPy. The article mostly talks about working with gradients and I was not immediately able to make a connection to my situation. Are we doing anything related to Symbolic Differentiation here (for the derivation of the quartic expression as well as for the derivation of the formula for the particle-halfplane polynomials)? As I understand it what we're doing is simply symbolic simplification of an expression. Is my assumption correct? 

The way I understand the above mentioned article is like this: the purpose of the article is to give an idea about common subexpression elimination (using sympy.cse). When I generated my code using Mathematica, I landed up with incredibly long expressions that are hard to debug. Using common subexpression elimination in SymPy should help reduce these expressions to more manageable expressions that are similar to the quintic formula. Is this assumption correct?

How do you declare a vector as a symbol in Sympy? If we do something like this we get an error: 

x, y, z = symbols('x y z')
>>> x.dot(y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<string>"", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'Symbol' object has no attribute 'dot'


And in my review of the matrices module, I could not find any way to declare a vector as a pure symbol (i.e. without allocating elements into the matrix). Any pointers would be much appreciated.

2. Your assumption is correct. I was not aware of that functionality when I used sympy so I just use good old regex to do substitutions. You should try on simple equations to make sure it works the way you expect before doing the homework with it though.

Thanks for your answer. A way to check if the derivation is incorrect would be to compare the computed result between the oracle and my code, wouldn't it ? Also, since the oracle throws a ""Wrong polynomial coefficients"" error only for the last three timesteps of ContinuousTimeTests/test04.xml, it should be quite fast.

First, I transformed the different terms with single variables, to get a clearer formula (writing ""a + t*b"" instead of ""x3(t) - x2(t)"" for instance). At this point, you get a sum of a few terms, and you'll want to expand them. 

The idea is to separate the derivations so you deal with smaller formulas. I expanded each term individually in order to identify the coefficients. Then you just have to sum up the different coefficients. The formulas are a bit long, and you need to be careful with mistakes, but there is no special trick the get the answer !

Is the derivation for diffusion derived from $$u_{new}\ =\ u_{old}+\frac{\Delta t\mu}{\rho}grad\ \bullet\ grad\left(u_{new}\right)$$

2. The change in density is density flux in - density flux out. Flux is amount over area, in this case, amount is diff * (xj - xi) , where xj is the ""other"" cell and xi is ""this"" cell. We divide by the area which is h^2, or, equivalently, multiply by N*N because h is 1/N. Since time is discretized, multiply everything by dt.

3.  You can find this equation in the jos stam paper in the references section. This is the diffuse part of the Navier Stokes equation. Our implementation tries to approximate this value stably with large time steps. $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=-(u\cdot\nabla)u+\nu\nabla^2u+f$$

Note also that the approximations for theme 5 looks realistic, but actually has very bad energy behaviour, so is only used in games. For film, we want solvers that look better, but can take longer. For engineering, we want more accurate solvers. Thus, the stable fluids solver fits nicely in the application for gaming due to its stability with large time steps (thus, fast, interactive run times). The approximations to the Navier Stokes (Gauss Seidel relaxation,...) are to serve the purpose of fast run times.",Huy,admin,hqh2101@columbia.edu,Djgardner,,dgardner010@gmail.com,CSMM104,102/discussion/11467,audit,verified

We have the special cases when the value we are looking at is ON the boundary. These velocities should be zero. I have two questions:



Do we completely skip solving x(i,j) when dealing with an i,j that's on the boundary to keep those values at 0?

When a x(i,j) is adjacent to one of these special on the border i,j values do you still add the border value (should be 0) and then divide the total number of adjacent values (including the on the border one)? OR do you skip adding it all together just like a value that's IN the border? 

I've tried it both ways and am still failing 3/4 NoDiffTests(which is strange because I would think those tests ignore diff but they fail even before any changes are added).

You now have a conceptual understanding of how the engine works, and (hopefully) a very good understanding of the actual animation parts. 

Since now, you have the entire code base of the animation engine, you could then have a go at implementing some algorithms from papers from the professor's research group, turning it into a game engine, or CFD/FE solver. These are very different directions to go to, and of course, a big jump from this class. The forefront of computer animation aims to make engines solve certain types of problems faster, or/and more accurately, and/or more beautifully, and the three directions I've listed above each chooses to optimize one of the three objectives.

However, this class has covered the basic approaches to a diverse range of subfields within computer animation. Therefore, it is likely that you can move forward learning about new algorithms by thinking about how they differ from the ones you've implemented.

Assuming you would want to focus on computer animation and not on graphics, I've had a good experience writing my engine, outputting the results to a binary file, then writing a blender add on to import the results into blender to render it.",Huy,admin,hqh2101@columbia.edu,Ericalin,,linchinlee@gmail.com,CSMM104,102/discussion/11827,audit,verified

I was unable to log in through the secure web browser via Google (stuck on a white screen), the PSI live support told me to restart the secure browser and try again. I did and got the same white screen failure when selecting log in via google. I decided to restart my computer and I reset my EdX password so I could log in without needing to go through the google link. But now I am no longer able to even get to the log in screen on the secure browser because I no longer have the exam code. When I select the final exam in the course to get the code it thinks I am in the middle of taking the exam and asks me to return to the RPN software and my 3 hours are counting down.

I either need the exam code or need to submit an empty exam and get it re-opened. By the time someone sees this I imagine I will be either out of time or low on time, so most likely I will need my exam reopened.

Please help.

For further information I was able to complete the practice proctored exam during week 7, but now for some reason the ""log in via google"" link is causing the secure browser to hang. This is considered step 3 so it's after all the verification and entering of the exam code, which caused the exam to start.

I've done the proctored exam genuinely by accomplishing all the PSI rules and regulations and scored 25.2/30.0. But today I received the following message,
"" Your proctored exam ""Final Exam"" in Animation and CGI Motion was reviewed and the team identified one or more violations of the proctored exam rules. Examples of issues that may result in a rules violation include browsing the internet, blurry or missing photo identification, using a phone, or getting help from another person. As a result of the identified issue(s), you did not successfully meet the proctored exam requirements."" 
It was so surprising and causing great mental agony to me. I was genuine and true to address the issue I had with the quality of my laptop webcam one day before I sat for the final exam. I wrote to PSI support team, Edx support team (Ayesha Murtaza replied) and to Course Staff (Abby(sh3146)  replied) regarding this issue before the exam. But none of that attempt addressed my issue properly. PSI support team told me if there's an issue with my practice proctored exam they'll let me know. But they didn't reply or gave a follow-up mail. So I went and bought an expensive stand-alone webcam with high resolution and focus feature and used that side standing webcam to do the final proctored exam. I took all the steps to my level best to adhere to the PSI rules. I'm from Sri Lanka which is the third world country where we can't guaranty the uninterrupted supply of Current and Intenet Connection. So I talk with the local Electricity Board and made sure that power will be on for the three hours of my proctored exam. I wrote the exam at midnight so that no surrounding noise pollution (Sound from the village Temple speakers, Sound from the Local shop speaker advertising, etc) in order to adhere to the PSI sound level. Now simply PSI inspection makes me guilty. This is not fair and also it is inhuman for a person who had tried his level best to qualify for certification in all the genuine way from a third world country where none of the university provides courses related to Computer Graphics. I'm always ready to take the exam again to prove my genuineness and potential. But please clearly state me what was the issue with my proctored exam? Was it my webcam quality is not satisfactory? Or was it I used a side stand webcam? Or any other reason. Just plainly giving a reply as stated above is so frustrating and it is of no help in improving the exam condition in the next sit. Please kindly be clear and specific regarding the issue which caused the proctored exam violation. Please take into consideration that when I take the exam again, I have to go through all the procedures from confirming the Electricity and the Internet is uninterrupted. And I have to write the exam at midnight (for the sound level) which comes at the cost of my next day's office work. This course already cost me the Course money $275 (which is huge when compared with my monthly salary which is $543.47) + a brand new webcam for $40 and one working day. Please consider all these facts into consideration and give me a solution either to retake the exam or clearing the hold on my previous exam result as soon as possible as the course ends on December 24th. I'm hopefully waiting for your kind reply.

I am very impressed by your persistence and all your work to get the exam setup done. Let me explain how the proctor software works and what the suspicious behavior means. 

 In a proctored exam, there are a lot of algorithms added based on the exam instructions. For example, if the books or notes are allowed or not. Can students use calculators etc? The software would apply those algorithms in addition to the basic appropriate exam behaviors such as not leaving the room, not wearing headphones, not looking away from the screen, etc. If any of those behaviors are detected, learners would be marked as having suspicious behavior(s). Then, a human proctor will investigate and decide if this is a violation. Later, it will go through an internal evaluation and you will be notified of the reason why you violated the exam. 

That says, there is no need for you to be panic. You can wait for the feedback on the initial analysis of your proctored exam. You will also have a chance to petition for your case. The instructional team will weigh in and provide feedback. So, if you follow the exam rules, you do not need to worry. Hope this explains what does the email means. 


Since you already finish all the coursework, assignments and exams before the 23rd of December, you already fulfilled your duty. You do not need to worry if the investigation past the course due date. That doesn't affect your credentials. 

Last but not least, we really appreciate your time with us and hope you benefit from the lecture and assignments. Apologize again for the hassle of the final exam, we are definitely in contact with edX to improve on the learners' experience. The discussion forum is still open and you can still reach us here.

When I searched the segmentation error number details online, it seems like a memory allocation issue, which is out of this assignment scope.

I've done the proctored exam genuinely by accomplishing all the PSI rules and regulations and scored 25.2/30.0. But today I received the following message, "" Your proctored exam ""Final Exam"" in Animation and CGI Motion was reviewed and the team identified one or more violations of the proctored exam rules. Examples of issues that may result in a rules violation include browsing the internet, blurry or missing photo identification, using a phone, or getting help from another person. As a result of the identified issue(s), you did not successfully meet the proctored exam requirements."" 
It was so surprising and causing great mental agony to me. I was genuine and true to address the issue I had with the quality of my laptop webcam one day before I sat for the final exam. I wrote to PSI support team, Edx support team (Ayesha Murtaza replied) and to Course Staffs regarding this issue before the exam. But none addressed my issue properly. PSI support team told me if there's an issue with my practice proctored exam they'll let me know. But they didn't reply or gave a follow-up mail. So I went and bought an expensive stand-alone webcam with high resolution and focus feature and used that side standing webcam to do the final proctored exam. I took all the steps to my level best to adhere to the PSI rules. I'm from Sri Lanka which is the third world country where we can't guaranty the uninterrupted supply of Current and Intenet Connection. So I talk with the local Electricity Board and made sure that power will be on for the three hours of my proctored exam. I wrote the exam at midnight so that no surrounding noise pollution (Sound from the village Temple speakers, Sound from the Local shop speaker advertising, etc) in order to adhere to the PSI sound level. Now simply PSI inspection makes me guilty. This is not fair and also it is inhuman for a person who had tried his level best to qualify for certification in all the genuine way from a third world country where none of the university provides courses related to Computer Graphics. I'm always ready to take the exam again to prove my genuineness and potential. But please clearly state me what was the issue with my proctored exam? Was it my webcam quality is not satisfactory? Or was it I used a side stand webcam? Or any other reason. Just plainly giving a reply as stated above is so frustrating and it is of no help in improving the exam condition in the next sit. Please kindly be clear and specific regarding the issue which caused the proctored exam violation. Please take into consideration that when I take the exam again, I have to go through all the procedures from confirming the Electricity and the Internet is uninterrupted. And I have to write the exam at midnight (for the sound level) which comes at the cost of my next day's office work. This course already cost me the Course money $275 (which is huge when compared with my monthly salary which is $543.47) + a brand new webcam for $40 and one working day. Please consider all these facts into consideration and give me a solution either to retake the exam or clearing the hold on my previous exam result as soon as possible as the course ends on December 24th.

Please note that this course is based on Professor Grinspun's class: Animation and CGI course for undergraduate class featuring advanced math at Columbia University. The grade could not be converted into the on-campus degree program since the rubrics of the grading scale is different. Additionally, the course is not 100% the same. According to the instructional team, this on-campus course is very hard for CS undergraduate and graduate levels. 

Personally I think taking the course online is harder because you don't have in-person interaction to ask questions or debate with the instructor and classmates. Overall, congratulations on completing the course with a high pass. I wish you the best of luck in your future studies in the US.

Due to the complication of the proctoring software, the course staff decided to extend the course due date until December 23rd, 2019, 23:30 UTC to let you take (or retake) the proctored final exam. Before you proceed, please make sure you follow these steps before you take the final exam:



Take the practice proctored exam to verify your system compatibility


Use your edX credential to log-in for the final proctored exam



If you use other 3rd party (i.e. facebook or google account) login, you will not be able to access to the final exam. 


Close all other tabs, communication apps or any add-on software (i.e. skype or messengers) to prevent any pop-up message which could result in your exam flagged as violating the proctor exam rules. 


There can be many background data using apps you have installed on personal laptops, or network blocking security systems in corporate computers. Each of these can make PSI flag your exam. Therefore, the simpler the computer used, the better. An option is to log in as a ‘guest’ user on your computers (but then, this depends on if you downloaded PSI under all users or your admin account).

If your exam gets locked out or blocked, note that the timer still runs. When it ends, your exam will be submitted for you. We understand this is an issue, and the best resolution is to contact info@edx.org to reset your exam and report this on the discussion forum. PSI cannot reset exams, but they can determine why you were logged out. 



We are here to assist you if you have any other questions.

It's rigorous, challenging and unforgiving. It's also been one of the best learning experiences I've had.

Here are some things I loved about the course:



Eigen is a delightful and intuitive linear algebra library to work with.

The TA's were responsive and answered questions quickly and patiently.

The structure of the course is excellent and builds from the ground up.

The Codio programming environment is great and avoids major yak-shaving issues associated with installation and environment setup.

I also learnt a lot about how to read through a C++ code base

The test cases provided are excellent and allow you to slowly step through your mistakes and wrong assumptions

The lectures are brilliant and simple to understand

In short, this course is a jewel. That said ... here are some suggestions ...

Suggestions:



Have a clear glossary for the course explaining terminology (including units and whether something is a scalar, vector or matrix)

Allow week 5 to move faster with a more comprehensive list of FAQ and possible hints at sticking points. For me, Week 5 (where we had to derive the quartic formula) was hell-week. I lost over 2 weeks not knowing how to proceed. This could have been avoided with better instructions on how to work with a computer algebra system.

Remove dependencies so that a student can move ahead on assignments without finishing the earlier bits of the program (ex: being able to make a peer review video without doing the coding assignment for the week)

Don't advertise it as 8 to 10 hours per week. I spent at least 20 hours a week on the course and I suspect a majority of course participants also spent many more hours a week than the advertised 8 to 10 hours per week. 

Allow for part marks on assignments. A student must be able to get marks on assignments in smaller segments  rather than the do-or-die kind of scenario that we're currently thrust into. This can be achieved by having more test cases on assignments so that students can slowly build their understanding with fewer assumptions (i.e. allow for implementation formula by formula)

Have (ungraded) formative assessments to help students test and strengthen their understanding / intuition and map out their weaknesses.

Have a clear section on symbolic algebra (CAS) where we are taught how to move from 1D representations of equations to 2D representations. 

Provide a formula sheet so users can take away something at the end of the course

Please feel free to add to this list or discuss. ",Leonardo1452,,vikram@ascendus.com,,,,CSMM104,102/discussion/13172,verified,
