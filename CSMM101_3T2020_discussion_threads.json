Be it online or in person, a healthy online learning community starts with some basics:\nBe respectful. Please respect your fellow students. Debate and pushing on ideas is part of a healthy and thriving learning community, but only when that is done in a polite and respectful manner. Insulting, condescending or abusive words will not be tolerated and will be reported and removed.\nBe constructive. A learning community is about learning with and through engagement with one another. When commenting on others' projects, try to offer constructive feedback and suggestions that help them improve it.\n \nBe sensitive. This is a global forum with participants from many different cultures and backgrounds. Be sensitive when discussing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or controversial topics since others may be more sensitive about them than you are.\n \nPost appropriately. Content that violates the Terms of Service is not permitted. You may not post inappropriate (e.g. pornographic) or copyrighted content, advertise or promote outside products or organizations, or spam the forums with repeated content.\n \nUsers that repeatedly post inappropriate content (see above) may lose their posting privileges, at the discretion of the course staff.\n \nPlease help us create a healthy learning environment by respecting these standards. We do not expect to see many of these issues because we trust students like you to keep our forum communities strong and healthy.\n \nIn addition, please consider the following guidelines when posting in the course forums. These guidelines were created to serve the community and make the forums welcoming and easy to use. If you have other suggestions to add, please let us know!\n\nFORUM POSTING GUIDELINES\n\nWhat makes a good post? The main goal of the forums is to provide a place where dialogue can build as the collective learning community digs into this content together. The forums are there for all learners to have a deeper, more meaningful learning experience, but there are a few things to consider when posting in the course forums:\n \nRead before posting. Your comment or question should build on what’s already been discussed. If you have a question, scan through to see if it’s already been addressed and use the search function to avoid creating duplicate threads and find the most appropriate topic thread to post in.\n \nUse informative titles. Keep your post titles short and on-topic so the forums are easier to navigate. If you’re asking a question, it should go in the title.\n \nMake it easy to read. Present facts and background in your post. Don’t capitalize or bold entire sentences since this makes the forums harder to read. Check your posts for spelling or grammatical errors.\n \nStay on topic. Don’t change the topic of a thread or split a thread into multiple discussions. If you are discussing something that is not directly related to the course materials, pick one thread instead of discussing over multiple threads. And please, don’t post the same post/question in more than one forum.\n \nHelp keep the site friendly. Any comment which is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate will be removed by the staff. \n \nThanks for keeping the conversation lively and respectful!",

I hope that study habit fundamentals can be an unsaid prerequisite of people attending the course (just like calculus, linear algebra, python), and if they need the help they can find many free resources online (e.g. for time management). Personally I graduated university while doing 2+ years 100% online and didn't need this help. Making basic time management and study habits a prerequisite and this reflection optional will give people more time to study more about AI or Python. \n\nThanks! :-)",

        "text": "There are a lot of things to break down in this, but as an autonomous vehicle fiend, I will give it a go!\n\n\"how atomous will these cars be?\"\n\nThis depends on the timeline you are looking at. Currently, there are various forms of automation that are implemented. These include collision avoidance, route planning, lane detection, and some fully autonomous features, such as Tesla's \"summon\" feature. There are a lot of predictions about when we will have fully autonomous cars, but it's completely dependant on the development race which is going on.

It is certainly true that AI will--to some degree--change, dislocate, and / or eliminate task and, therefore, impact the nature of work and job roles (Iansiti & Lakhani, 2020).  However, in more recent years, it has been observed that businesses who are leading AI adoption are finding ways to incorporate AI and employees into collaborative teams that leverage their strengths to create impactful business solutions.  According to the 2020 Global Human Capital Trends report by Deloitte, business are finding ways to mitigate the loss of employees by providing various resources to help re-integrate them in a way to work with AI technology.  Yes, even as jobs are eliminated and the nature of work will change; new tasks and new job roles will be created. The key will be how companies are successful in creating and developing ways to augment their workforce rather than replacing them.\n\nPatrick, personally, I am hopeful that in the future, the nature of work will be a positive evolution and we will find ourselves as a society in harnessing the power of AI that will benefit us all.\n\nThank you for sharing ",

    "text": "\"We are heading toward autonomous driving\" is the first sentence of the second discussion question of week 1, and what a statement to kick the course off with. Some people will agree, others won't. I believe agreeing or not is merely a question of perception. Are we talking about full autonomous vehicles (level 5) on large scale in the coming 10 years, then I agree to disagree. However when we move the time horizon to +30 years, I tend to agree with the statement. A statement for which the author, most likely, chose the words carefully: \"heading toward\" does not specify a how fast or which level of autonomous vehicles (1-5)...\n\nSo what will it take us to get there? In terms of artificial intelligence a few aspects immediately jump to mind: computer vision detecting road signs, people, other vehicles and much more in a vast amount of driving situations (city, urban, highway, off-road) and conditions (sunny, rain, snow, fog,...), connected networks able to communicate with one another in real-time and optimize traffic flows, autonomous fleet management, human-machine-interface (HMI) able to communicate with passengers without having to learn to recognize their voice commands, ... only to say a few. \n\nPersonally, as I am a simulation engineer of innovative hybrid powertrains, I also have a strong believe autonomous vehicles, combined with additional artificial intelligence, can be used to reduce the carbon footprint of the transport industry on the planet. A lot of research has been done and some vehicles even already include some kind of \"predictive control\", however this is still rule-based at this time. Taking the joystick away from the driver, allows not only the optimization of the individual vehicle on its journey, but could open the gate to so called \"co-operative driving strategies\", allowing a multitude of vehicles to align their driving style to reduce overall energy consumption (reduced braking/acceleration, reduced stops). Aside from the benefit for the planet, the passengers would also experience a more fluent and probably even quicker journey to their destination.\n\nBut before we get there, we will need to remove some big roadblocks and overcome challenging hurdles. On technological level, artificial intelligence is expected to get better and better with more training (more data), just as we do when we learn how to drive. However in order to obtain level 5 autonomous vehicles, the requirements are very high: \"At Level 5 autonomy we arrive at true driverless cars. Level 5 capable vehicles should be able to monitor and maneuver through all road conditions and require no human interventions whatsoever, eliminating the need for a steering wheel and pedals.\"(https://www.truecar.com/blog/5-levels-autonomous-vehicles/). \n\nA first challenge that is unavoidable is that not all vehicles will immediately be autonomous. It is much easier to ensure safe operation in a controlled environment. When all vehciles would be autonomous, a proper communication system will result in rather safe operation. However human actions are unpredictable and it is hard to train an artificial intelligence to anticipate the, sometimes flawed, decision making of human beings. This is why the first \"autopilot\" systems are always in highway or in traffic jam conditions. City driving is much more dynamically changing and requires many more inputs to be processed which could (should?) influence the decision making process. However this point is, I believe, more of a hurdle than a roadblock. Many companies and research institutes are already investigating city driving with autonomous vehicles and I am quite certain this will become possible within a reasonable timeframe. \n\nOne of the major real roadblocks according to me is regulation: car manufacturers require legislative institutes to clearly define which tests a vehicle needs to pass before a vehicle can be called \"level 5 autonomous\". Without such a definition, level 5 autonomous vehicles can never become a reality. But the definition of this legislation is not a task that should be taken lightly and can take >10 years (as a reference the definition of the \"new\" WLTP took ~20 years).\n\nAnother roadblock is the ethical decision making question: in an accident that cannot be prevented, who lives and who dies? Without a steering wheel the passengers have nothing to say in the answer to this question.\n\nThen there is the hurdle of liability: what if an accident happens, who is responsible? The car manufacturer? The sensor manufacturers? The company who trained the artificial intelligence? How much redundancy is needed to ensure a failproof system on a worldwide scale?\n\nAnd finally, and probably even most importantly, security: handing the control of a car to a computer system makes it very vulnerable to dangers which are currently not existing on a road. Imagine if all vehicles would be autonomous and a terrorist group is able to obtain control, the amount of casualties would be countless. Ensuring the highest level of security in a product that should be sold in mass for a reasonable price is not an easy task.\n\nTo summarize, I believe a lot needs to happen on...:\n(I also added some points I didn't discuss above)\n\nPolicy level:\n\nLegislation\n\nLiability\n\nPrivacy (connected networks: how much data can be recorded and saved?)\n\nTechnological level (research)\n\nInteractivity of autonomous vehicles in a human-driver populated city. \n\nSecurity\n\nHorizon for connected networks\n\nInfrastructure (didn't go into detail here but feel free to ask if anything is unclear):\n\nData processing facilities (centralized/decentralized)\n\nAutonomous-only driving zones in cities\n\nAre traffic lights still necessary?\n\nBack-up systems (redundancy)\n\nConnected networks data centers\n\nEven though this is a challenging task, I am certain we have the capability to overcome them in the coming 30 years and am looking forward to order a self-driving car via my app to bring me to the supermarket to do grocery shopping.\n\nLooking forward to read your opinions about my view on this topic.\n\nKind regards,\n\nNathan\n\nPS: for who would be interested: I am an automotive powertrain simulation engineer and have also previously followed the courses from Dr. Lex Friedman at MIT (MIT Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lectures).",

            "text": "Hi Victor,\n\nThank you for your response and opinion. \n\nThe idea of having dedicated roads for autonomous vehicles seems interesting and could avoid the problem of interaction with human controlled vehicles (I don't think this \"solves\" the problem, but rather avoids the conflict). However, I believe this would limit to great extent the implementation of autonomous vehicles on a wide scale. Imagine building a road between 2 cities which is only allowed to be used by autonomous vehicles. The passangers can travel between the 2 cities but they don't have a means of transport aside from public transport inside the cities.

            "document": "<document version=\"2.0\"><paragraph>Hi Victor,</paragraph><paragraph>Thank you for your response and opinion. </paragraph><paragraph>The idea of having dedicated roads for autonomous vehicles seems interesting and could avoid the problem of interaction with human controlled vehicles (I don't think this \"solves\" the problem, but rather avoids the conflict). However, I believe this would limit to great extent the implementation of autonomous vehicles on a wide scale. Imagine building a road between 2 cities which is only allowed to be used by autonomous vehicles. The passangers can travel between the 2 cities but they don't have a means of transport aside from public transport inside the cities.

We are not developing AI because we are \"crazy scientists\". AI can tackle already existing problems for our survival, like the use of natural resources, climate change, society and political problems that may lead to unrest and war like poverty among others, diseases that may be unexpected (like the current pandemic) and so on.\n\nAI can actually help us avoid extinction and that is why we are developing it.

The option is not whether to develop AI or not but whether to develop AI ourselves with the right ethics or leaving it to others that may have the wrong ethics. Especially with the current availability of a set of principles and technologies that are leading to AI development, the choose to develop or not AI is not possible on a global scale. We can choose as research teams or even as nations to not develop ourselves such systems, but we will be leaving that option to terrorist, hackers or simply any groups of individuals (companies, etc) to do so. AI development is not an option, it is a global race towards a goal and if we really care about AI not becoming a human destruction weapon we must be the first to actually develop and master AI with the aim to increase likelihood of human survival even in circumstances when that means counteracting bad AI.\n\n\n\nSecond, and this would be a very controversial opinion and I beg pardon from whomever may feel offended for what I am about to say, the idea of superintelligence subsiding human intelligence and causing human extinction sounds more to me like evolution than  anything else. What if we imagined the transition from human intelligence to general artificial superintelligent systems in the same realm of the transition from homo erectus to homo sapiens? Not all evolutionary steps have to be identical though they are all probably caused by the environmental needs and the adapting behaviour of the species so why cannot we tell that we are at a more complex stage of evolution where we actively participate with the use of our intelligence in the development of our own next evolutionary step? What if the future species in human species path is GAI? I do not want for sure to be killed by an android or other kind of GAI but I do not mind our species being replaced by it in the arch of generations. In fact, the very concept of extinction in this regard is complex. I think we want better lives for ourselves and probably for our children, but isn't species survival beyond the actual scope of individuals? If a superintelligent agent far ahead from us in terms of intelligence as to be able to develop itself even more intelligent is possible, I do not think they will have any interest in directly killing us. We have come up as humans with systems that actually preserve other species in the animal world so I cannot imagine such superintelligent system seeing us an actual threat to them and thus they will not have any need to kill us, unless they understand we represent any threat to the whole environmental system of this planet and they are not able to come up with a solution other than intentionally eliminating us.

        "text": "Hi everyone, I also agree with Victor we should have just one single discussion thread for DQ1, so allow me to answer in this same thread.\n\n\"Should we be concerned about Artificial Intelligence? Is AI a threat to humankind?” \n\nI’ll also not comment on the position of Gates, Musk and Hawking’s because I also believe that the press as took them out of context and took them out of proportions.\n\nThe answer to these questions is not easy, and I dare to say it might have two possible answers. \n\nThe answer to \"Should we be concerned about Artificial Intelligence?\", can be yes if we take as reference the impact that AI will have in the human society in a near future, when reading the article “Is Artificial Intelligence Permanently Inscrutable?” it is described an experiment at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which shows how AI gave unexpected results due to the data used for training the model, meaning that AI might produce wrong results which will harm other human beings.

Of course I posses basic understanding and being in IT industry for 10 years has given me enough opportunity to be at least early consumer of first few applications of early AI.\n\nSo with that let me try to articulate what I think of AI and if that can be a threat to the humankind.\n\nYes is my short answer. It can be a threat to the humankind, but we have to be super wrong in the process of developing/enhancing AI capabilities. The current applications of AI as we read in the articles referred in here are actually applications of narrow AI, now we all understand that narrow AI exists to solve a specific problem  and it can definitely cause some undesired outcomes like human fatalities but is not any close to causing human kind to extinct. What we are talking about here is AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and its advanced levels/stages. \n\nAs I understand it, we are nowhere close to achieving AGI, a lot more has to be learned and experimented to reach that level. The narrow AI can take many forms and uses different methods to solve different problems and has no common sense and is purely driven by data, whereas AGI is thought more like a child in its initial phases, where a singular system would be able to learn all the complexities and we will be able to apply AGI to solve varieties of the problems, it will also be able to apply its learnings from solving a problem while solving completely different set of problems and will posses common sense and will be nourished and taught like a baby and will be taught the purpose of its existence which will be to guide and help the human race. \n\nNow if you think about baby and how/what we teach them. We teach them how to behave in the social world, what is accepted and what is not. And it of course is not acceptable to hurt anybody, is it? I believe the AGIs are going be taught all these fundamental human social behavior/values and develop its common sense before anything else. And everything that they will learn will be on top of that. One additional thing that I believe will be engrained in these AGI systems is purpose of their existence which is to serve human race.\n\nAnd just like a baby if you think about it, they will be able to unlearn what they were taught and make their own perception about the things based on their own experiences, the same can be applicable to AGI systems and which means one day these AGI systems will be grown ups and would want to do things how they want to do them. And they will be able to lie and hide things from human race just like an adolescent sometime behaves with his/her parents. And that will be the moment when human race will be able to understand why an AI system does what it does. \n\nBut in the mean time until such AI system is close to be ready which is many decades from now, AI and its applications will greatly benefit the human race, will help in making new discoveries and will open completely new fields of research and science and will solve many unsolved difficult problems and will also help its own evolution. Because both human race and at some point AI would want to learn more and more and then reach a stage when AI do not need human race to teach them anything anymore.\n\nGiven all these things the development/deployment of AI based systems will need to be continuously monitored and validated, governments will have to come together to make some sort of world organization to keep things under check. \n\n",

Eventually, as we see the benefits for people that can't drive (for many reasons, age or disability), commercial use, and we'll come to accept some level of risk, the same way we accept the risk of air flight. </paragraph><paragraph>Challenges that autonomous cars need to deal with are mostly ourselves, humans, which are unpredictable, can cross street without paying attention, other human drivers, etc. </paragraph><paragraph>In a much distant future, all cars will be autonomous, they will go much faster and will be in synch, communicating with each other to avoid collisions. Imagine Waze but among cars being the ones alerting each other of hazards in the road, traffic, people or dogs in street, etc. Street lights will not be needed for cars but for pedestrians only.</paragraph><paragraph/><paragraph/></document>",

It might even need to understand a distinction between different human beings for cases when a car will have to make an important difficult decision to choose a human over another if that's the only option car has.\n\nRobotics - It needs to be able to move/drive reliably of course.\n\nSmart networks - Cars need to be able to form a smart intelligent network among each other and talk to each other to assist each other to make better decisions. This will help in so many cases like where a car in trouble can warn other vehicles near it about its condition and help itself and others too from getting into a serious situation. The smart network can enable so many use cases like smart navigation, where cars can guide each other to make a best possible decision to choose a best possible route.\n\nSpeech recognition/NLP  - It will help riders to be able to freely communicate with car and be confident that car will do whatever it takes to keep the rider safe. \n\nSmart diagnostics- Cars will have to understand its own health and warn/alert users in cases where undesired signals are detected.\n\nCars will also need to be connected to various external systems for possible alerts and act reasonably, signals like extreme weather alerts, natural disaster alerts, terrorists attacks alerts, crime reported alerts, etc will be some of the sources that cars will have react to.\n\nEtc\n\n\n\nWhat will it take to have autonomous driving be part of our daily life(on the policy level, infrastructure level, research level, etc.),\n\nOf course policies will have to adopt new environment, the most challenging part of the policy will have to consider this hybrid system where smart cars will have to exist along with non smart vehicles for a long time. The policies will have to open enough to not harm/stop the innovation while keeping safety/risks in mind. \n\nThe current generation of autonomous cars are built on the bases of existing infrastructure and rules and of course the infrastructure is not in absolute needed shape everywhere an autonomous will have to operate, the standards for infrastructure will have to be high and strict than before. It is going to play equal role in the interim before autonomous cars become an application of AGI, when it will be operate in any condition like a human being can.\n\nThe research will have to be continuous, the thing about AGI and machine learning algorithm is that they will require continuous testing/validation to make sure that the system behaves in an expected in unforeseen open environment. The research in this domain will help us understand the AI better and make it more efficient and safe with each iteration.\n\nWhen do you think this will happen?\n\nIt is definitely is close at least for the first generation of autonomous cars , I would way we might see autonomous cars operating without requiring drivers to keep their hands on steering within a decade from now.",

The smart network can enable so many use cases like smart navigation, where cars can guide each other to make a best possible decision to choose a best possible route.</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Speech recognition/NLP  - It will help riders to be able to freely communicate with car and be confident that car will do whatever it takes to keep the rider safe. </paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Smart diagnostics- Cars will have to understand its own health and warn/alert users in cases where undesired signals are detected.</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Cars will also need to be connected to various external systems for possible alerts and act reasonably, signals like extreme weather alerts, natural disaster alerts, terrorists attacks alerts, crime reported alerts, etc will be some of the sources that cars will have react to.</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Etc</paragraph></list-item></list><paragraph/><paragraph>What will it take to have autonomous driving be part of our daily life(on the policy level, infrastructure level, research level, etc.),</paragraph><list style=\"bullet\"><list-item><paragraph>Of course policies will have to adopt new environment, the most challenging part of the policy will have to consider this hybrid system where smart cars will have to exist along with non smart vehicles for a long time.

It is going to play equal role in the interim before autonomous cars become an application of AGI, when it will be operate in any condition like a human being can.</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>The research will have to be continuous, the thing about AGI and machine learning algorithm is that they will require continuous testing/validation to make sure that the system behaves in an expected in unforeseen open environment. The research in this domain will help us understand the AI better and make it more efficient and safe with each iteration.</paragraph></list-item></list><paragraph>When do you think this will happen?</paragraph><paragraph>It is definitely is close at least for the first generation of autonomous cars , I would way we might see autonomous cars operating without requiring drivers to keep their hands on steering within a decade from now.</paragraph></document>",

Aren't nodes popped from the frontier when explored?  I don't see why this search necessarily takes more memory than others.  \n\n2) (Sort of a follow-up to above).  What constitutes a unique node in A*, especially for our project?  Because we are now considering total cost, is a unique node any node with a specific configuration (state) and a unique total cost?  Or does it go deeper, and consider a node to be unique only if configuration, total cost and action to get there are unique?  Along these lines, does the frontier store each unique node, meaning that there might be multiple nodes with the same state, but different in other aspects, such as total cost?  \n\nThanks!",

To make each key unique, I added a second priority key, which was simply based off a counter that increased for each node as expanded.  It worked and doesn't add much code, but to me it seems a little bit like programmatic duct tape.  I wonder if there is a more eloquent way...  \n\nThanks!",

What I had done originally was use cost (number of moves to reach a state) + Manhattan Distance + a nominal value for direction of action (.25 for down, .5 for left, etc), to prioritize the states as per the assignment.  The problem I ran into was that I still had duplicate numbers (3.75 for two different states that both happened to use \"right\").  My work around of indexing additionally according to when a mode was added to the frontier does work because I put tuples of three values into the heap (total cost, index, puzzle_state).  So I guess my question is, what about those case where the cost metric is identical and the action is identical too?  This throws a key error, unless I use that index work around.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\nDavid",

    "text": "Hi,\n\nIn the Week 3 lecture for A* Search at minute 4:54 the professor doesn't seem to adequately cover how the frontier.decreaseKey(neighbor) part of the algorithm works, even though there are 2 Oklahoma's added to the frontier (see image below from lecture). In the Week 2 UCS algorithm lectures this decreaseKey isn't covered well either. I'm currently adding every node to the Heap with its self.cost+manhattan_cost as the \"Key\" for the Heap values (which is the same as g(n)+h(n)). However, to \"decrease\" this key for a child node, do I need to remove the child node with the lessor \"Key\" value from the Heap (which if using a list remove function would be O(n) time)? I've been guessing at what \"decrease\" means so I'm wondering if I can get any hints. :-)\n\nI know I could just try adding duplicate nodes (e.g. 2 \"oklahoma\" frontier nodes with their key values) to the Heap since they have unique object IDs with keys. The Heap would likely still pick the one with the smallest key value anyway.

In the Week 2 UCS algorithm lectures this decreaseKey isn't covered well either. I'm currently adding every node to the Heap with its self.cost+manhattan_cost as the \"Key\" for the Heap values (which is the same as g(n)+h(n)). However, to \"decrease\" this key for a child node, do I need to <italic>remove</italic> the child node with the lessor \"Key\" value from the Heap (which if using a list remove function would be O(n) time)? I've been guessing at what \"decrease\" means so I'm wondering if I can get any hints. :-)<break/><break/>I know I could just try adding duplicate nodes (e.g. 2 \"oklahoma\" frontier nodes with their key values) to the Heap since they have unique object IDs with keys. The Heap would likely still pick the one with the smallest key value anyway. So the only drawback would be my Heap could grow a little larger when two parents have the same child -- which would use up more memory.<break/><break/>Any ideas?

It returns an error (failed items, see below) immediately instead of running the different models.\n\nDue to the absence of RUN button, there is no way to debug without submitting dozens of times (which probably won't look too good on the reports).\n\nI'm using Python 3.6.4.\n\n\n\nAny idea how to solve this?\n\n\n\nHere are the libraries I'm using - maybe some are not compatible?\n\nimport

I also think with the very 1st grid map state it could be immediately hitting a flat local maximum where it wanders the plateau forever (which I think is a brutally difficult introduction to minimax). I may need to set some limit and increment it within in the min and max functions' arguments, perhaps for depth or sideways moves, and just return a random move when the limit is reached. Perhaps the limit is a check condition for the \"is terminal\" or \"eval\" functions in the minimax algorithm.\n\nFor the very first state.map of [[0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0][0,0,4,2]] I noticed that the recursion between max and min player kept oscillating the between the actions of 0 (UP) and 1 (DOWN). It's maybe because the utility of all possible moves for each player was 0 (a flat local maximum), and these indexed moves were the first available in the list of moves, so each player would always return their first available indexed action (0-UP for Max player, 1-DOWN for Min player). \n\nThe same state would be passed back and forth without any change in the resulting state's utility for either player. This may have created a tree of the states (a1: up) [[0,0,4,2][0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0]] and (b1: down) [[0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0][0,0,4,2]]  going hundreds of nodes deep until it hit the recursion limit in Python.\n\nI just changed IDEs from VSCode to PyCharm.

It works for bfs and A* but it does not work for dfs. I call this function once node has been found to be the 'goal_node' (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8).</paragraph><pre>def find_solution_dfs(node, start_node):\r\n    solution = []\r\n    solution.append(node.action)\r\n    path = node\r\n    while path.parent != start_node:\r\n        path = path.parent\r\n        solution.append(path.action)\r\n    solution = solution[::-1]\r\n    return solution</pre><paragraph>Is anyone able to provide any hints as to how to retain only the 'true dfs path to node'? </paragraph><paragraph>Thanks in advance for your help!</paragraph></document>",

When their MAX player is anticipating MIN player's \"actions\" for future states, the MIN player's \"actions\" are literally anticipated by MAX to be a random placement of a 2 or 4 tile.

The MAX player can anticipate much easier game states. Stanford then goes into how to optimize this further with expectimax (section \"B. Expectimax\").\n\nI don't know what I'm doing wrong.

    "text": "Hello Course Team,\n\nI would like to ask a question about the random placement of 2 and 4 values in the grid. I hooked up my algorithm to play against the game in 'https://hczhcz.github.io/2048/20ez/' and I always get the 2048 mark or better. However, when I run it against the GameManager_3 in the skeleton code I barely get up to 1024.\n\nCould some one explain the logic behind the random number placement? I have already tried multiple heuristics and it is really tough to beat the GameManager_3\n\nThanks",

        "text": "I will also share my experience as this assignment was certainly challenging.\n\nThe time limit poses a challenge. I added two parameters to play with: depth and max branches (for mini portion of the minimax). The mini portion would have to check all possibilities, i.e. 14 empty spaces and possibility of a 2 (90% probability) and a 4 (10% probability). That's a lot of branches. If you go deep all the way down, it would take forever. I played with values of depth 2, 3, 4, 5... and with max branches: 1, 2, 3, 4... In the end, I settled in the range of depth between 4-6 and max branches of 4-5. I could have tweaked this to get better and be able to do more, but I stayed in that range.\n\nThe heuristic is the most important and the most difficult part. As mentioned, one method is not enough. I played with number of spaces, max value, number of adjacent tiles, and it was not enough. I added weight to the heuristic value to favor cases in which max value was on top row, top corner, top quadrant, left column, and that helped. I replaced number of blanks with average (sum of all values divided by number of tiles > 0).  I spent a lot of time playing with different weights and values, running it again, capturing results in Excel, tweaking, etc. You can go crazy going through all of these, and unfortunately, not easy to really compare heuristics since each run is different due to random selections of new values, so you can't really compare unless you run them many times. At some point, you need to live with a \"good enough\" heuristic...\n\nInterestingly, I could get to 2048 a few times in my local computer, but when I ran it in vocareum, i only got it once even if I ran it multiple times. I know it is all random. I also noticed vocareum was actually faster than my local computer so I could have probably pushed my parameters to go deeper.\n\nI hope this helps.",

On Vocareum it gives 50% 512 and 50% 256 with dumb heuristic of number of available tiles.\n\nBefore moving to improve the heuristic, I need to implement a time limit instead of hard depth in the IDS, because I have no idea how much the heuristic functions I want to implement will take and so a hard depth is a bad idea. I saw there was another post on this called \"Time Limit...\" by @burricks.\n\nI implemented something similar to @burricks :\n\ndepth = 1\nwhile not timesup:\n    find solution with current depth\n    depth += 1\n    updateTime()\n\ndef updateTime:\n    timesup = True if current time - init time > timelimit\n    \n\nThe problem with this is that the time of each depth increases exponentially. So let's say at depth 4, my time difference is << the limit of 0.2 (say 0.05), I go into depth 5 and that time difference is now 0.7. The 5th depth search actually finishes and the search is halted by the while loop, but once the result goes to the game manager it is halted it took  >0.2.\n\nHere are my questions:\n1- do we even allow the 5th depth to start if we know for instance that it will blow through the time. By that I mean should the time limit be enforced inside the search function as well or should we halt before calling the 5th depth?\n\n2- Is there a better way to do this time update.\n\n\n\nThank you\n\n",

        "text": "After a few hours spent researching strategies for playing the 2048 game, including having my husband paying it himself for quite some time ;), I have managed to improve the heuristics to give 512 max tile value. I have also cleaned the code a bit to make it easier to read and a bit faster. \n\nSpending time in coming up with the right heuristics does pay off. I never got it to pass the 64 threshold just with the alpha-beta pruning alone. I think the assignment documents are misleading on that front. The heuristics need to be way more sophisticated than just the average tile value or median of the tile values. They really need to 'draw a strategy' for playing the game.T\n\nEither way, in case anyone is feeling a bit lost (as I was), here is the code I have written for the PlayerAI.py. It is also available on GitHub here: https://github.com/mariamingallonMM/AI-SearchAlgorithm-A2-2048puzzle.

        "document": "<document version=\"2.0\"><paragraph>After a few hours spent researching strategies for playing the 2048 game, including having my husband paying it himself for quite some time ;), I have managed to improve the heuristics to give 512 max tile value. I have also cleaned the code a bit to make it easier to read and a bit faster. </paragraph><paragraph>Spending time in coming up with the right heuristics does pay off. I never got it to pass the 64 threshold just with the alpha-beta pruning alone. I think the assignment documents are misleading on that front. The heuristics need to be way more sophisticated than just the average tile value or median of the tile values. They really need to 'draw a strategy' for playing the game.</paragraph>T<paragraph>Either way, in case anyone is feeling a bit lost (as I was), here is the code I have written for the PlayerAI.py. It is also available on GitHub here: <link href=\"https://github.com/mariamingallonMM/AI-SearchAlgorithm-A2-2048puzzle\">https://github.com/mariamingallonMM/AI-SearchAlgorithm-A2-2048puzzle</link>. Note that I have modified GameManager.py from that provided in the assignment to include for selenium to run the game on a html page. It is work-in-progress though as explained in the docs.</paragraph><pre>from BaseAI import BaseAI\r\nfrom typing import Tuple, List\r\nfrom Grid import Grid\r\nfrom sys import maxsize as MAX_INT\r\nimport math\r\nimport time\r\nfrom itertools import chain\r\n\r\n\r\nclass PlayerAI(BaseAI):\r\n\r\n    global MIN_INT, timeLimit\r\n    MIN_INT = -MAX_INT - 1\r\n    timeLimit = 0.2\r\n\r\n       \r\n    def getChildren(self, grid: Grid, minmax: str) -&gt;

I've italicized problem paragraphs]\n\nHi Anton,\n\nI'll try to answer your question about the redundancy of forward checking in the case of having already reached arc consistency.\n\nThe forward checking suggested in the book is, as you said, running AC-3 on a subset of all arcs in the CSP. Specifically, the arcs involving the variable in question and its neighbors.\n\nArc consistency is achieved by running AC-3 on all the arcs in the CSP. If we reach arc consistency and then run forward checking, we will be checking arcs that have already been considered and made consistent by exactly the same algorithm. Therefore, it's redundant.\n\nI'm going to take a guess about what's confusing you and try to address that, please correct me if I'm wrong or just ignore what follows:\n\nYou mention \"making an assignment to a non assigned variable\" and then running forward checking. I'm guessing you're thinking that, because we make an assignment before checking, we are constraining the problem more and should be able to make more inferences.\n\nHowever, consider the nature of arc consistency. Namely, for an arc (X1, X2) it is consistent iff all the values of X1 have some value of X2 for which they are consistent. I.e. the arc (X1, X2), if consistent, is consistent for all the values of X1, so when the algorithm assigns a value to X1 we know that value is consistent already and forward checking won't tell us anything else.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nMark",

Specifically, the arcs involving the variable in question and its neighbors.</italic></paragraph><paragraph><italic>Arc consistency is achieved by running AC-3 on all the arcs in the CSP. If we reach arc consistency and then run forward checking, we will be checking arcs that have already been considered and made consistent by exactly the same algorithm. Therefore, it's redundant.</italic></paragraph><paragraph>I'm going to take a guess about what's confusing you and try to address that, please correct me if I'm wrong or just ignore what follows:</paragraph><paragraph>You mention \"making an assignment to a non assigned variable\" and then running forward checking. I'm guessing you're thinking that, because we make an assignment before checking, we are constraining the problem more and should be able to make more inferences.</paragraph><paragraph>However, consider the nature of arc consistency. Namely, for an arc (X1, X2) it is consistent iff <bold>all</bold> the values of X1 have some value of X2 for which they are consistent. I.e. the arc (X1, X2), if consistent, is consistent for all the values of X1, <italic>so when the algorithm assigns a value to X1 we know that value is consistent already and forward checking won't tell us anything else.</italic></paragraph><paragraph>Hope that helps.</paragraph><paragraph>Mark</paragraph></document>",

Or shall I create all that I need on the fly?\n\nI finished the assignment, and got near full points even when using the project's own default stopwords.en.txt file. I didn't use my own or any other stopwords. Perhaps you could try your own, but their stopwords file works sufficiently well I think.

We do this in Vocareum before executing 'driver.py': \n\nline=$(awk 'NR==5 {print; exit}' sudokus_start.txt)\n\nwhere NR == 5 is for the fifth line\n\nwe can print the value of the variable $line in bash by doing:\n\necho \"$line\"\n\nFinally, we execute 'driver.py' to run with $line:\n\npython3 driver.py \"$line\"\n\n\nUsing AC3 and Backtrack Search:\n\nI have found the explanation of the assignment somewhat confusing at first. Reading the assignment about ten times and reading all the various posts from the rest of the students, things started to make more sense. \n\nWhat they mean by \"To check how powerful BTS is compared to AC3, you must execute AC-3 algorithm before Backtracking Search algorithm.\", or at least my interpretation is as follows:\n\nCreate a function/method (or a class) that executes AC3 as per Fig 6.3 in the AIMA book (including the function revise used inside the main AC3.\n\nCreate a function that executes BTS as per Fig 6.5 in the AIMA book, so there is a backtracking-search and a backtrack function; the latter is called in the former.\n\nThe backtrack function is actually where the 'search' for the solution happens.\n\nIf you implement 'backtrack' per fig 6.5 in AIMA book, the first thing is actually to check that the puzzle at that stage is not already 'solved'.\n\nThen inside 'backtrack' call a function (e.g. 'get_unassigned') that gets you the values from the puzzle board which are 'unassigned'; it should give you the 'key' of the value (e.g. 'A1', 'A2', etc) and the domain of that value (e.g. [1,2,3,4]) which will depend on other values in the same row, column or 3x3 square. This is represented by \"var < - SELECT-UNASSIGNED-VARIABLE(csp, assignment)\" in the pseudo code of fig 6.5.\n\nThen for each 'var' in the 'domain of var', as given by the 'get_unassigned' function, assign the value to a copy of the starting 'csp' (e.g. local_assignment dict) and set the value of the 'unassigned' dict as False for the 'key' just assigned. \n\nIf the value 'var' is consistent with the assignment, then continue to call AC3 inside BTS (backtrack-search, backtrack). \n\nNext, test if it has been able to 'solve' the puzzle. If AC3 alone is capable of resolving it, then return the result at that point. In that case, the 'method' will be 'AC3.\n\nIf AC3 was not able to 'solve' the puzzle, then carry one with the puzzle in the state that AC3 has left it and call in 'backtrack' (recursively inside backtrack). Before doing that, check that the value is still consistent. \n\nNote that you need to update the dict 'unassigned' with the latest puzzle achieved by AC3 before calling 'backtrack'. I was not doing that and I was passing on the starting 'unassigned' dict which did not align with the 'local_assignment' dict for the puzzle at that time. It cost me a few days to figure it out and I felt a bit hopeless for a while so if I can make someone avoid that error that would make very happy ;)\n\nNext, we test the resulting puzzle from calling 'backtrack'; if the result from 'backtrack' did not return a valid result (not empty), then we call 'forward_checking' as an additional inference to reduce the domain of the unassigned variables when we step out of the loop 'for each value in ORDER-DOMAIN-VALUES'. Again we apply 'forward_checking' on the latest version of the 'local_ssignment' and 'unassigned' dicts.  \n\nIf the assignment is not consistent, ensure those values are reverted back to their original values and 'unassigned' status so that when we call 'get_unassigned' again we can try with a different domain. \n\nFinally, when running 'get_unassigned' it is essential to order the (key, vars) results considering the length of the array/list 'vars' so that the 'keys' with the smallest domain (smallest length of the possible values) get assigned first. This will implement the 'minimum-remaining-values' (MRV) heuristic as explained in section 6.3.1. of the AIMA book. \n\nI also spent a bit of time trying to get rid of the \"\" when saving to txt because I was using dataframe and .to_csv to do so. It turns out it is best to use 'with open() and .write' as follows:\n\ndef write_txt(filename_outputs:str = 'output.txt', final_str:str = None): \n\n    # write the outputs csv file \n    filepath = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'data', filename_outputs) \n    var = final_str \n\n    with open(filepath, 'a') as out: \n        out.write(var + '\\n') \n    return print(\"New Outputs file saved to: <<\", filename_outputs, \">>\", sep='', end='\\n')\n\n\nAlso, my code is not the most beautiful thing ever (could improve how it reads with more time) but in case it helps as you read the above, it is all available on GitHub here:\n\n https://github.com/mariamingallonMM/AI-CSP-Sudoku-A4\n\nHope this helps!\n\nBest,\n\nMaria",

Want to learn deep learning in 2 weeks even if you don't know what regression is, sure why not? Most ML courses simply teach you the libraries, without going any deeper.

I can only speculate to the reason for discontinuing these programs (maybe Columbia wants its own online platform, maybe the Vocareum charges and TA effort make the course unsustainable...), but one idea I would like to put forward which you might consider at a later date is to make these courses more quiz driven (maybe write the program, but enter only a final value as the answer to a quiz); you already have all the material, all it would take is a one time effort. Harvard does it for a lot of their courses. Also peer reviewed assignments are another option. All of them come with their own challenges of course.\n\nFinally if we are to part ways, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the staff for making these available for so long.

    "text": "Greetings!\n\nI finished my program for the Optional Assignment of Week 9 about Reinforcement Learning and I want to share my results and insights.\n\nThis was a really interesting side-project and I'm glad I tried it. By doing it I was able to understand better the reinforcement learning lectures and now I'm more interested in this topic of AI.\n\nThe policy iteration and value iteration algorithms were kind off easy to code, but the QLearning one was more challenging, because I had to adapt the code to serve as a simulation without explicitly giving any information of the probability of transition to an specific state or the structure of transitions.\n\nYou can check out my code here: https://github.com/Carlitos5336/ReinforcementLearning\n\nThese are my answers to the questions from the assignment:\n\nQuestion 1\n\nWe used the policy iteration method to find optimal policy for discount factor 0.1. Try using this method with a different discount factor, for example a much larger discount factor like 0.9 or 0.99, or a much smaller one like 0.01. Does the optimal policy change?\n\nThese are my results with different values of lambda:\n\nThe greater the lambda, the more the policy values the future rewards, so it prefers to keep a safe strategy by always choosing the Slow Action.\n\nIn contrast, when the lambda is close to zero, the policy values more the nearer rewards, so it prefers to take the Fast Action in the Moving State.\n\nQuestion 2\n\nNow, try using the value iteration method instead. How does the number of iterations change? What about the complexity of implementing each iteration?\n\nThese are the number of iteration my algorithm takes for each method using lambda = 0.1.\n\nIn fact, the number of iterations using value iteration method is higher than the ones using policy iteration method as proffesor Shipra Agrawal said in one of the lectures.\n\nIn terms of complexity,  the most important difference between the two is that in policy iteration method the algorithm calculates the VPI (value function pi) for each iteration, and to calculate the VPI we need to find the inverse of the following matrix:\n\n$$I-\\lambda P_{\\pi}$$\n\nThat is based on the bellman equations for MDPs.\n\n$$v_{\\pi}=\\left(I-\\lambda P_{\\pi}\\right)^{-1}\\cdot r_{\\pi}$$\n\nSo this operation of calculating the inverse adds a lot of complexity to the algorithm specially because it will repeat several times. In a system with hundreds and thousands of states and transitions, to calculate the inverse of the matrix would be too time consuming. That's why in terms of the number of states and transitions, the policy iteration method is more complex than the value iteration method.\n\nQuestion 3\n\nWrite a python script to implement the Q-learning method (without exploration) for this simple MDP. Run this script several times. Does the algorithm always converge? Now, try adding a simple epsilon greedy exploration and rerun. \n\nI tested the epsilon-greedy exploration case with an epsilon value of 10%\n\nWhen using the QLearning method alone just with a greedy exploration by using the action that maximizes the q-value it rarely converges to the same answer in terms of q-values, but it yields almost always the same policy. In the case of the one with epsilon -greedy exploration, the q-values converges almost always and sometimes gets the best policy we found with the other method.\n\nFor example, in this case, it yielded a different and better value.\n\nQuestion 4\n\nPick your favorite single player computer game, for example, Cart-pole balancing. How would you model the problem of learning to play this game (without needing to know the physics of the game) as a reinforcement learning problem? Define the state space, action space, transition model, reward function and goal of the underlying MDP.\n\nOne of the games in wich I'd like to develop an AI using Reinforcement Learning is Tetris.\n\nThe goal for the AI would be to fill each cell of the different rows with the different random pieces completely without leaving holes, so the pieces never get to the top of the board.\n\nFor every time step of the game, the action space would be [do nothing, move left, move right, rotate]\n\nThe state space would be the set of all possible combinations of filled and non-filled cells of the board.\n\nThe transition model will be based on the position of filled and non-filled cells that produces an action from a state.\n\nThe positive reward could be relative to the amount of filled cells in a row, and negative reward for the amount of holes in the board.\n\n",

    "text": "Dear students, \n\nWe'd like to share with you some tips and resources which could be beneficial for you if you are interested in applying for an online MS in CS: \n\nApplication requirements: \n\nAn undergraduate degree in Computer Science. If you have an undergraduate degree in a different field, you must take six prerequisites (four grade- and credit-bearing courses in Computer Science and two math courses, preferably Linear Algebra and Differential Equations). These courses must be completed before applying to the MS and can be taken at a university and must be issued on a transcript. MOOCs and work experience do not waive this requirement.\n\nA minimum undergraduate cumulative GPA of 3.3 (around a B+, 87-89% average)\n\nThree letters of recommendation, preferably two should be from professors if you graduated fewer than five years ago from your undergraduate or graduate degree program\n\nGRE General Test scores (optional for Spring, Summer, and Fall 2021)\n\nA resume/cv\n\nA personal/professional statement\n\n$150 application fee \n\nTips to strengthen your application:\n\nFor those who do not have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science - Again, you must complete the four CS courses and two math prerequisites prior to applying. Aim for at least a B+ in each course. You can take any CS course offered, but here are a few examples of typical CS courses: Intro to Computer Science (COMS W1004 or COMS W1007), Advanced Programming (COMS W3157), Data Structures and Algorithms (COMS W3134 or W3137), which is a prerequisite for most of our graduate-level courses, or/and Discrete Math (COMS W3203). These courses are not offered at CVN so I suggest that you take them at your local community college or four-year university. \n\nConsider taking the GRE General Test - While the GRE General Test is completely optional for the Spring 2021, Summer 2021, and Fall 2021 terms, doing well on the exam, (i.e., scoring at least a160/170 on the Quantitative section, 158/170 on the Verbal section and 4.5/6.0 on the AWA) can demonstrate your ability to handle a strongly quantitative program. Give yourself about two months to prepare for the exam. \n\nEnroll in a non-degree course at CVN, no more than 2 - Non-degree courses are essentially the same courses you would take if admitted to the MS program without having to enroll in a degree program. Nearly all of the courses offered can be taken on a non-degree basis, you simply have to meet the prerequisites of the course. Most students choose to take one or two of the core courses listed under the Courses tab. To learn which of these courses will be offered next term, the Spring 2021 course list is now available. The prerequisites can be found in the course descriptions. The credits from these courses, up to six credits(or two courses), can be applied to one of our degree programs. Aim for at least a B+ in these courses and develop a relationship with the professor so that you can request a letter of recommendation when you have completed them. Please note that taking a non degree course does not guarantee admission to the MS program. Since these are the same courses you would take if admitted to the MS, the tuition is the same, about $6,983 per course. To apply, submit a non-degree application via this link. \n\nSecure strong letters of recommendation, preferably at least two from current or former professors - Think critically about the skills that translate to success in a graduate engineering degree program and find appropriate recommenders who can testify to your ability in these areas: leadership, quantitative, analytical, and English writing/speaking skills, ability to work on a team and independently..etc. \n\nExplain gaps and/or red flags in your personal statement - Performed poorly your first semester of college? Worked three jobs during your differential equations course? Experienced some personal tragedy that impacted your work/academic performance? Paint a picture for the Admissions Committee about what happened and how you overcame it to assure the Committee that the issue was addressed, and, more importantly, will no longer be a concern if admitted to the program. \n\nComprehensive resume/CV - Highlight not only jobs relevant to your intended field of study, but also unrelated positions that have taught you transferable skills (leadership, quantitative, analytical, and English writing/speaking skills, ability to work on a team and independently..etc) that will lead to success in an engineering program. Be sure to include published research, volunteer positions, leadership roles in student or professional organizations, internships, and of course, paid positions.\n\nPlease note that CVN Admissions cannot provide guidance on edX/MicroMasters-related matters (upcoming courses, refunds, certificates..etc).\n\nFor more information about CVN’s admissions process, I encourage you to attend a weekly informational webinar. Webinars are held every Tuesday and Thursday from 2 pm - 2:30 pm ET. To register, click here. CVN Admissions can be contacted at info@cvn.columbia.edu or via phone at (212) 854-6447 press option 2. \n\nOn-campus residential CS Masters Program Admission website link: https://www.gradengineering.columbia.edu/graduate-admissions/application-requirements",

I have also tried different learning rates and number of epochs to try and optimize the line as much as possible. </paragraph><figure><image src=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/neF9BMuLmzbe8EAgSaEndYox\" width=\"378\" height=\"252\"/></figure><paragraph>The weights used to plot this line are from my Vocareum output. Below is an example of my output1.csv. Am I making some glaring mistake in the format of this file (the last 2 show convergence)? </paragraph><figure><image src=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/f35adKX4zQsqO91fAbyucrSM\" width=\"643\" height=\"393.799043062201\"/></figure><paragraph>Any help would be much appreciated as I feel I am spending many hours on a problem that (I think) I have already solved. </paragraph></document>",
